The COA is reviewed and approved by the University administration. The following information explains how the COA is determined and the role it plays in calculating your total financial aid package. The Cost of Attendance not only provides baseline information on how much it will cost to attend SMU, but it is also determines the maximum amount a student is eligible to receive in total financial assistance. It is the starting point for building a financial aid award that combines scholarships, grants and loans from various funding sources into a single award package. The combined total of all funding sources cannot exceed the COA. Keep in mind that the COA, as it relates to your financial aid, is the estimated cost for the majority of students enrolled in a degree seeking academic program. It includes allowances for tuition, fees, housing, dining, transportation, books, supplies, and miscellaneous expenses. The amount used for each expense category will vary depending on the degree plan, specific program of study, number of enrolled hours, and choice of housing. Direct Costs vs In-Direct Costs Direct costs: Educational expenses that are billed directly by the University such as tuition, fees, housing and dining for students living on campus. In-Direct costs: Expenses that are directly related to your education, but not billed by the University. For example, students living off campus are expected to pay rent and utilities. These expenses are related to your education, but are not billed directly by the university. They are "in-direct costs". The amounts may vary significantly depending on a student's choice in housing, neighborhood, utility service plans, etc. 2023-2024 Annual Estimated Undergraduate Cost of Attendance The following information is based on enrollment for the fall and spring terms, and registered as a full time student (12-18 credit hours) for each term, Summer and Inter-term expenses are not included in the following example. To determine exact tuition and fees based on 1-11 enrolled hours, please see the University Bursar's Direct Cost of Attendance webpage. Off Campus living expenses are specific to the individual student and should be considered when evaluating your housing options. Expenses will vary significantly due to the choice of neighborhood, apartment rental rates, number of roommates, or living with parents. Graduate and Professional Cost of Attendance The following information is based on estimated expenses for a single student, living off-campus, without a roommate. Information for International Student I-20 Requests can be found here. Direct Costs (Typically billed by SMU): Tuition rates and fees for Graduate programs vary depending on your academic program. To determine exact direct costs for your specific program of study, please see the University Bursar's Direct Cost of Attendance page. Tuition (See Bursar's Direct Cost page )* Student Fees (See Bursar's Direct Cost page )* In-Direct Costs (Estimated expenses not billed by SMU) Allowance for Off-Campus Housing & Dining, Books, Supplies, Loan Fees, Transportation, & Miscellaneous expenses Online programs in-direct cost allowance $27,237 $24,387 **Allowances are estimated based on off-campus housing. Expenses for living off-campus are specific to the individual student and will vary significantly depending on the type of housing, choice in neighborhood, home leasing/rental rates and the number of occupants.

Early Decision Skip to main content SMU Explore SMU Academics Student Affairs About SMU News Events Calendar Research George W. Bush Presidential Center Current Students Alumni Information for Faculty & Staff Apply to SMUGIVE NOW Undergraduate Admission Apply Visit Financial Aid Menu Search Apply First Year Early Decision Early Decision First Year Dates and Deadlines Early Decision Testing Admission Requirements Class Profile International Students Homeschool Students Request Information Self-Reported Test Scores Additional applicant types Choosing the decision plan that's right for you. What is the difference between Early Decision and Early Action? Early Decision is a binding agreement that requires you to withdraw all other applications and attend SMU if admitted, provided you are offered sufficient financial assistance. Early Action, on the other hand, is a non-binding program. If admitted in Early Action, you are not obligated to withdraw all other applications, and can still choose which school you wish to attend. While the Early Action deadline and notification dates are earlier than Regular Decision, you have until the national reply deadline of May 1 to decide whether or not you wish to attend SMU. Who should apply Early Decision I? Students who identify SMU as their top choice college prior to November 1 are encouraged to apply Early Decision I. If admitted, students are expected to enroll and immediately withdraw all other applications. Who should apply Early Decision II? Students who identify SMU as their top choice college after November 1 but before January 15 are encouraged to apply Early Decision II. In addition, students who believe their application may be more competitive in our process after submitting fall semester grades and/or additional test scores should apply Early Decision II. If admitted, students are expected to enroll and immediately withdraw all other applications. Who should apply Early Action? Students who identify SMU as one of their top choice colleges by November 1 should consider applying Early Action. If admitted, students still have until May 1 to compare offers and respond. How do I apply as an Early Decision candidate? In order to submit an early decision application, students should file an application for admission with the application fee by November 1 for Early Decision I and by January 15 for Early Decision II. Candidates should check the box on the application indicating that they are applying under a binding Early Decision plan and submit the signed Early Decision Agreement Form with the application. Because the Admission Committee releases decisions for Early Decision applicants within 4-6 weeks of the deadline, it is very important that the required information from the guidance/college counselor and teacher be submitted by the stated deadlines. If I am applying to SMU Early Decision, can I apply to another school Early Action? Yes. Students may apply to only one Early Decision program, but this does not prohibit you from applying to another school under a non-binding admission plan. If you are admitted to SMU under the Early Decision plan, you must withdraw all other applications, pay your nonrefundable $685 Orientation, Housing and Matriculation Deposit, and attend SMU. What is the difference between the Early Decision I and Early Decision II plans? The only difference is the dates. Many students make early college visits and know by November that SMU is their first choice school and are able to file an Early Decision I application. Other students apply Early Decision II because their decision to apply early was made after the Early Decision I deadline or because they want the Admission Committee to review new test scores and/or fall term grades as part of their application for admission. When will I receive a decision on my application? Students who apply Early Decision I by the November 1 deadline will be notified of the decision on their application by mail in mid-December. Students who apply Early Decision II by the January 15 deadline will be notified by mail by March 1. While Early Decision candidates may file non-binding applications to other colleges, if they are admitted under one of the Early Decision plans they must immediately withdraw all other applications and enroll at SMU. How do I apply for financial aid as an Early Decision applicant? Students who know they are applying Early Decision to SMU and wish to receive an estimated financial aid award notice must submit prior-year tax returns and register online with the College Scholarship Service and submit the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE® by the Early Decision deadline. You may file the CSS/PROFILE® as early as October 1. You will receive your finalized award notice once you complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), which determines eligibility for state and federal financial aid and the CSS/PROFILE®, which determines eligibility for university need-based aid. The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) priority deadline for Early Decision applicants and all other applicants is February 15. SMU’s FAFSA school code is 003613; the CSS/ PROFILE® code is 6660. Please visit SMU's Office of Financial Aid website for more detailed information about applying for need-based aid and other financial aid deadlines. If I am admitted Early Decision and am applying for financial aid, when will I be notified about my financial aid package? Admitted students who submit prior-year tax returns and register online with the College Scholarship Service and submit the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE® by the Early Decision deadline will receive an estimated aid offer along with their admission packet. This offer is based on information submitted on the College Scholarship Service CSS/PROFILE® form as well as submission of your parents’ prior calendar year tax returns. A final aid offer will follow in the spring, pending receipt of your Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). In the unlikely event that information on your FAFSA varies significantly or your family circumstances have changed significantly from original estimates, your financial aid package may change. Students who do not submit the required financial aid information by the Early Decision application deadline will not receive an estimated award. The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) determines eligibility for federal and state financial aid (found at www.fafsa.ed.gov). The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE® (found at student.collegeboard.org/profile) determines eligibility for university need-based aid. There is a $25 cost for completing the CSS/PROFILE®. Does SMU meet full financial need for ED candidates? SMU seeks to provide the best possible financial aid package for each student in the form of grants, loans, and the Federal Work Study Program. At this time, SMU does not have the ability to guarantee that full need will be met for applicants. Please access and complete our Net Price Calculator, a tool that gives students an early indication of the amounts and types of financial aid for which they may qualify. I am interested in Music, Theatre, Dance, Studio Art, or Film & Media Arts (BFA). Can I apply ED? Yes. Students in areas requiring dual admission -- admission to both SMU and to a specific Meadows division -- may apply ED. Applicants in these areas should carefully note the audition and portfolio submission deadlines. Additionally, students in these areas should note that most artistic scholarship awards are not determined until after all auditions and portfolio reviews have taken place. For additional information please click here. I want to be considered for the President’s Scholars or the Hunt Leadership Scholars. Can I apply ED? You may certainly apply Early Decision I or II if your decision to attend SMU does not depend on being offered one of these scholarships. Separate from the need-based financial aid process, the President’s Scholarship and Hunt Leadership Scholarship selection does not take place until well after the Early Decision process. If your enrollment at SMU depends on being named a President’s Scholar or Hunt Leadership Scholar, we would advise you to not apply under our binding Early Decision options.

An ACT superscore is a new final composite score that is made up of the best individual section scores across all ACT tests taken. The average of these best individual section scores is calculated to create a brand-new composite ACT score. Writing is not counted. Students can report the superscore calculated. At the time of enrollment, students must produce each official sitting that would calculate to the score self-reported. For example, if three different ACT testings together create the superscore, SMU will need the results from each of the three testing administrations at the time of enrollment. SMU does superscore the SAT. This practice has been in place for several years. If you have questions about superscoring the ACT, please contact your admission counselor. Find and connect with yours at www.smu.edu/counselor. Self-Reporting of Standardized Test Scores SMU began accepting self-reported standardized test scores in Fall 2018. Only ACT and SAT scores will be accepted as self-reported scores. This excludes the TOEFL and IELTS. SMU will accept test scores from high school transcripts, ones provided by the testing agency, or by an applicant’s high school counselor. The official test scores are required at the time of enrollment. At this time, SMU is not accepting self-reported transcripts/grades. Students can enter their test scores on The Common Application and on the MyCoalition Application on the testing page of the application. On the ApplyTexas application, students will not be prompted to enter test scores. Once the application is submitted, students will be able to self-report scores using the form on the personalized application status page. If you have submitted an application and would like to submit new self-reported test scores, please do so via your personalized application status page. SMU is fully test-optional.

Admission Requirements Skip to main content SMU Explore SMU Academics Student Affairs About SMU News Events Calendar Research George W. Bush Presidential Center Current Students Alumni Information for Faculty & Staff Apply to SMUGIVE NOW Undergraduate Admission Apply Visit Financial Aid Menu Search Apply First Year Admission Requirements A holistic approach to the admission process In addition to GPA and SAT or ACT scores, our admission committee weighs many factors during the course of the application process, including classroom performance, the rigor of high school curriculum, quality of essays and recommendations, extracurricular activities, talents, character, and life experiences. But what's most important for you to know is that your application will be considered individually, on its own merit. Minimum High School Course Requirements 4 units of English 3 units of math (algebra I, II, geometry) 3 units of social science 3 units of science (of which 2 must be lab science) 2 consecutive units of foreign language GPAThere is no absolute "cutoff" for grades. Classroom performance would generally present competitive applicants in the top quarter of their high school class. The difficulty of curriculum and competitive nature of the high school are also important factors in the admission process. Testing Standardized Test Requirements Official SAT or ACT scores. SMU does superscore the SAT and ACT, and also accepts self-reported test scores. Please note SMU does not require the SAT essay or the ACT writing test. Receiving Test Scores When the ACT or SAT is taken, students may indicate three schools to receive their scores. When SMU is indicated, the College Board sends us a record of your scores four to six weeks later. SMU's code for the ACT is 4174, and our code for the SAT is 6660. AP/IB SMU grants credit and placement for scores of 4 or 5 on most AP examinations taken in high school. Six to eight credits will be awarded for scores of 5, 6, or 7 on International Baccalaureate higher-level exams, with a maximum award of 32 credits. For more information, click here. To receive credit for an AP test in high school, arrange for an official copy of your test scores to be sent to SMU's Registrar Office. Upon receipt of this information, SMU will determine the credit you will receive. Test-Optional Policy SMU is fully test-optional. Please reference our Test-Optional Policy. Credit Correspondence Course Credit SMU does not accept correspondence course credit, however, such coursework may represent to the Admission Committee a commitment to study beyond the minimum high school curriculum. Concurrent (Dual Credit) High School/College Programs SMU first-year students may request college credit for coursework taken during high school. In order for this credit to be transferable to SMU, the course(s) must meet all regular transfer requirements: The course(s) must be completed at an accredited school; The course(s) must be grades of C- or better in comparable SMU courses; The course(s) must be submitted on an official college/university transcript; and The course(s) must NOT be a correspondence course. To process your concurrent credit, please request that official college/university transcripts be sent from each institution you have attended. Please note that even though you may not be granted course credit, SMU must receive official transcripts from any college or university you have attended. It is the student's responsibility to ensure that a professional evaluation and an official transcript accompany all foreign transcripts.

The Admission Committee will focus on your college coursework and transferable GPA for admission. The Committee finds that students with a 2.70 transferable GPA or higher are the most competitive for admission. In the admission process for transfer students, we evaluate both the rigor of the college courses you've taken and the readiness for your intended major. We recommend taking all or some of the prerequisite courses for your intended major before transferring to SMU. All transfer students are required to complete college algebra or a college-level math course before transferring to SMU. If algebra I, geometry and algebra II were taken in high school and graduation was less than three years ago, this requirement is waived. We recommend that all transfer students complete an English composition course, a lab science course, a math course beyond college algebra and at least one course in your intended major before transferring. Close × First-Year Transfer Students First-year transfer students are those students who have fewer than 30 transferable hours or who have graduated from high school within the last calendar year. If three or more years have passed since your high school graduation, we highly recommend that you acquire 30 or more transferable hours before you transfer. All first-year transfer students will be automatically considered for first year academic-based scholarshipsbased on your high school academic performance, including high school GPA, curriculum, and SAT or ACT test score. In order to qualify for transfer scholarships you must complete at least half of the 50-hour requirement after your high school graduation. In addition to evaluating your college course work and transferable GPA, the Admission Committee will also review your high school curriculum, high school GPA and standardized test scores. Your official test scores will need to be submitted directly from College Board or the ACT unless they are reported on your official high school transcript. The Admission Committee can begin review of your application after receiving all official college transcripts, but may not be able to make a final admission decision until your high school transcript and test scores have been received. All transfer students are required to complete college algebra or a college-level math course before transferring to SMU. If algebra I, geometry and algebra II were taken in high school and graduation was less than three years ago, this requirement is waived. Close × International Transfer Students Description of International Transfer Students here. Close × Performing and Visual Arts All transfer students who intend to major in dance, music, theatre, studio art or film (BFA) must complete an audition or portfolio.

Close × Economics Majors To enter SMU as an economics major, transfer students must have 30 or more hours of transfer credit and a minimum all-college cumulative GPA of 2.700.

Admission Requirements Skip to main content SMU Explore SMU Academics Student Affairs About SMU News Events Calendar Research George W. Bush Presidential Center Current Students Alumni Information for Faculty & Staff Apply to SMUGIVE NOW Undergraduate Admission Apply Visit Financial Aid Menu Search Apply First Year Admission Requirements A holistic approach to the admission process In addition to GPA and SAT or ACT scores, our admission committee weighs many factors during the course of the application process, including classroom performance, the rigor of high school curriculum, quality of essays and recommendations, extracurricular activities, talents, character, and life experiences. But what's most important for you to know is that your application will be considered individually, on its own merit. Minimum High School Course Requirements 4 units of English 3 units of math (algebra I, II, geometry) 3 units of social science 3 units of science (of which 2 must be lab science) 2 consecutive units of foreign language GPAThere is no absolute "cutoff" for grades. Classroom performance would generally present competitive applicants in the top quarter of their high school class. The difficulty of curriculum and competitive nature of the high school are also important factors in the admission process. Testing Standardized Test Requirements Official SAT or ACT scores. SMU does superscore the SAT and ACT, and also accepts self-reported test scores. Please note SMU does not require the SAT essay or the ACT writing test. Receiving Test Scores When the ACT or SAT is taken, students may indicate three schools to receive their scores. When SMU is indicated, the College Board sends us a record of your scores four to six weeks later. SMU's code for the ACT is 4174, and our code for the SAT is 6660. AP/IB SMU grants credit and placement for scores of 4 or 5 on most AP examinations taken in high school. Six to eight credits will be awarded for scores of 5, 6, or 7 on International Baccalaureate higher-level exams, with a maximum award of 32 credits. For more information, click here. To receive credit for an AP test in high school, arrange for an official copy of your test scores to be sent to SMU's Registrar Office. Upon receipt of this information, SMU will determine the credit you will receive. Test-Optional Policy SMU is fully test-optional. Please reference our Test-Optional Policy. Credit Correspondence Course Credit SMU does not accept correspondence course credit, however, such coursework may represent to the Admission Committee a commitment to study beyond the minimum high school curriculum. Concurrent (Dual Credit) High School/College Programs SMU first-year students may request college credit for coursework taken during high school. In order for this credit to be transferable to SMU, the course(s) must meet all regular transfer requirements: The course(s) must be completed at an accredited school; The course(s) must be grades of C- or better in comparable SMU courses; The course(s) must be submitted on an official college/university transcript; and The course(s) must NOT be a correspondence course. To process your concurrent credit, please request that official college/university transcripts be sent from each institution you have attended. Please note that even though you may not be granted course credit, SMU must receive official transcripts from any college or university you have attended. It is the student's responsibility to ensure that a professional evaluation and an official transcript accompany all foreign transcripts. Send all college-level transcripts to: Concurrent/Dual Credit Processing Southern Methodist University - DES PO Box 750181 Dallas TX 75275-0181 If you are an admitted student and are planning to enroll in college-level coursework the summer after your high school graduation, please be prepared to inform your Academic Advisor of this intent during your session which will occur during orientation. You will be notified of your transfer work as quickly as possible. If your concurrent credit does not meet the above criteria, you may choose to take AP exams offered by the College Board, or you may choose to take optional departmental exams after you complete orientation. Receiving Credit for a Course Taken at Another College Arrange for the college to forward an official transcript to SMU. If you are a transfer or first-year applicant, send the transcript to the SMU Division of Enrollment Services. If you are a continuing SMU student, send transcripts to the SMU Office of the Registrar. Essay We want to learn more about you and evaluate your writing skills. Each application (The Common Application, ApplyTexas, the SMU Online Application, and the MyCoalition application) has its own set of essay prompts with varying length requirements, but essays are generally 250 – 650 words in length. No matter which application method you choose, all essays are reviewed equally. Foreign Language As a requirement of the University Curriculum (UC), all students must demonstrate proficiency in a second language. Students who do not enter with the equivalent of four semesters of college-level second language proficiency prior to matriculating at SMU are required to improve their proficiency by two-semester levels or to meet the four-semester proficiency requirement, whichever comes first. Proficiency can be demonstrated in numerous ways; to determine which path applies to you, please click here to refer to the detailed description of the requirement. Majors Double Majors At the time you apply for the first-year admission, you will have the opportunity to indicate the two areas of study you are most interested in pursuing. If you want to be considered for admission to the Cox School of Business, you need to indicate that at the time you apply. When students get to SMU, they work with their academic advisors to determine the best course of study for all the majors they would like to pursue. Choice of Major/Admission If you are planning to major in Art, Film (BFA), Dance, Music, or Theatre, a required audition or portfolio is a critical factor influencing your chance of admission. Otherwise, all first-year SMU students are accepted as "pre-majors" in Dedman College of Humanities and Sciences, regardless of their intended major. If you want to pursue a major in finance, accounting, management, marketing, and other areas of business administration, you must indicate that interest on your application to be considered for direct admission to the Cox School of Business. Cox School of Business Applying to the Cox School of Business Incoming first-year students who want to pursue a major in finance, accounting, management, marketing, and other areas of business administration in SMU’s Cox School of Business apply for direct admission.

Meadows School of the Arts Test-Optional Policy for Dual Admit Applicants to SMU Meadows School of the Arts An SAT or ACT score report is not required for admission consideration from applicants who are seeking admission to Dual Admit programs in the Meadows School of the Arts (Music, Theatre, Dance, Art, Film-BFA). Applicants should only submit an SAT or ACT score report for academic merit scholarship consideration. The recommended combined score to be considered for academic merit scholarships is 1380 on the SAT (critical reading and math sections only) or 29 on the ACT. Note that students who do not submit test scores will be considered only for artistic scholarship and need-based aid; they will not be considered for scholarships based on academic merit. Students who do not submit test scores should list their Meadows major first on their application for admission. Students not admitted to Meadows via their portfolio or audition, but who still wish to be considered for admission to SMU, will be required to submit test scores at that time. Like other top-tier visual and performing arts schools, SMU’s Meadows School of the Arts has adopted a Test-Optional Policy for Dual Admit applicants in Music, Dance, Theatre, Art, and Film-BFA. These students complete auditions or submit portfolios that, after careful review, provide a stronger indication of their likelihood to succeed in their academic program at SMU.

Homeschool Students Skip to main content SMU Explore SMU Academics Student Affairs About SMU News Events Calendar Research George W. Bush Presidential Center Current Students Alumni Information for Faculty & Staff Apply to SMUGIVE NOW Undergraduate Admission Apply Visit Financial Aid Menu Search Apply First Year Homeschool Students Homeschool Students First Year Dates and Deadlines Early Decision Testing Admission Requirements Class Profile International Students Homeschool Students Request Information Self-Reported Test Scores Additional applicant types SMU happily accepts and reviews applications from students attending non-traditional high schools, including homeschools and online high schools. A student who has been home-schooled is subject to the same review as a student applying from a traditional high school (please follow the application instructions). We ask that all home-schooled students complete the Homeschool Supplement. The SMU Admission Committee makes the following additional recommendations for home-schooled students to help them be as competitive as possible in the admission process: Curriculum In our review of applicants, we like to see students challenging themselves academically. Regardless of which curriculum you follow, the committee would like to see, at minimum: Four units of English Three units of mathematics (suggested: Algebra I, Geometry, Algebra II) Three units of science (including two units of laboratory science) Three units of social science Two units of a foreign language (full two-year sequence) Please be aware that students who go above and beyond in the rigor of their academic curriculum generally have an advantage in the admissions process. The average number of core academic courses for an admitted student is 20 units. Official Transcript The admission committee will need something to help us measure your success as a student in your homeschool program. We understand that an official transcript may not be available. If this is the case, please submit a transcript with a consistent grading scheme and/or course descriptions including textbook titles so that we can fully understand your program and what was used to determine proficiency in each academic area. You can use the space provided on the Homeschool Supplement or provide a document in your own format. While not required, it may be beneficial to have your transcript notarized. Recommendation Letters As you will see on our application checklist, a counselor recommendation is required and a teacher recommendation is highly recommended. The counselor recommendation should come from the individual who has coordinated your educational experience and can provide information about the curriculum you used. The teacher recommendation can be completed by a teacher, tutor, or the advisor of an activity in which you participate. If you and your educational coordinator (i.e. “counselor”) feel that your application would be better served through your teacher/tutor recommendation, you are welcome to waive the counselor recommendation by submitting a statement. The wording for this statement can be as follows: I, [Full Name of Educational Coordinator], would like to waive my right to provide a counselor letter of recommendation for [Applicant’s Legal Name] on account that the teacher recommendation letter by [Full Name of Teacher/Tutor] is a better representation of the academic merits of this applicant. Under the terms of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), the applicant has waived his/her right to access the teacher’s recommendation form and letter. We understand that we may not be eligible to review or otherwise inspect the letter of recommendation prior to submission to SMU. Dual-Credit & AP/IB/SAT II Exams Many home-schooled applicants challenge themselves by taking dual-credit courses from local accredited colleges or recommended standardized exams. Because each homeschool experience is different, SAT II subject test and/or AP/IB scores and college-level courses can provide the committee with an additional measure of your ability in core academic subject areas such as English literature, math, and science. We look forward to working with you and reviewing your application for admission. Please feel free to contact Anna Lee Buehn with any homeschool-related questions.

With the exception of Music students auditioning in December, it is not required that you complete your application to SMU prior to scheduling an audition or submitting your portfolio; however, candidates are encouraged to do so. All Meadows admissions are contingent upon successful admission to the University. Do I have to submit SAT or ACT scores? No. SMU is currently fully test-optional. Read more about the SMU Test-Optional Policy. When will I know about my SMU admission? Please see Dates & Deadlines for notification time frames. Note: Only students who wish to major in Dance, Music, Theatre, Art or Film and Media Arts (B.F.A.) are required to complete an audition/submit a portfolio. If you don’t plan to major in these areas, you shouldn’t list them as your first-choice major on your SMU application. When will I know about my Meadows admission? Results are generally emailed as follows: Music and Dance-within two weeks of audition, Theatre-within three weeks of audition, Art and Film-within two weeks of portfolio submission deadline. When will I know about my scholarship package? Students who have been admitted to Dance, Theatre, Music, Art or Film and Media Arts (B.F.A.), or have been selected for the Meadows Scholars program, typically receive their scholarship packages between the end of March and early April. May 1 is the national response deadline to accept or decline awards and admission to SMU. What’s the CSS Profile/FAFSA? Your first step in funding college is to complete the CSS Profile and the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). You cannot receive, any financial aid from SMU without completing both these forms. Don't wait to be accepted to complete them - apply early, while you are submitting your applications. The U.S. Department of Education runs a variety of student financial assistance programs, which include grants and loans. Your eligibility for aid is determined by the information that you provide in the CSS Profile and FAFSA. SMU will also use your FAFSA to determine your eligibility for scholarships, grants and institutional aid. These forms are not required of international applicants. Review the Meadows Scholarships and Financial Aid page for more details. Do I have to complete the CSS Profile and FAFSA or the Meadows Waiver Form every year? If you wish to be considered for need-based financial aid or federal student loans you must complete these forms each year. The Meadows Waiver Form only needs to be completed your first year if you are only receiving academic or artistic merit awards and do not plan on submitting the CSS Profile or FAFSA.

But even if you are a top talent, it can be a challenge to get into the college you want. Your application will be one of many submitted by outstanding high school and transfer students from around the world. To increase your chances of admission, it’s important to keep your academic grades high. Be active in your school or community. Before you send in your application, read college websites and social media to get familiar with their programs and opportunities. Attend info sessions either in person or virtually. When you fill out your application, and you audition or send in your portfolio, let them know what differentiates you from all the other applicants. Be the one who shines. Preparation is key Whether applying for music, dance, theatre, film or studio art, be sure to perform, shoot or create as much as possible while in high school. Music: Performing in summer programs, community productions, master classes, private lessons, for friends and parents, etc. will boost your skills and your confidence. The more you perform, the less nervous you will be at audition time! Research the school’s audition requirements ahead of time and start working on your audition piece well ahead of audition day. Theatre: When choosing audition monologues, help the audition committee get to know you: Choose a character fairly close to you in age from a play about which you passionately care. Although you want to show your range, going too broad can be a trap – the committee may not learn enough about you by seeing you portray an 80-year-old serial killer. Come to the audition ready to play. Stay open to anything thrown at you – welcome the challenges! Dance: Prepare a solo that presents your qualities, technical abilities and expressive range in the best possible light. Get input from your teachers/coaches on the style and content of your solo, and ask them to help you bring it to a high level of performance. Come to the audition thinking of it as a learning opportunity, just as you do when you go to a technique class: Listen carefully to the directions during the audition and don’t be afraid to ask clarifying questions. The most important thing is for the auditioning committee to see the artist in you shining through! Art: Actively create art in your school classes or take classes in your community, and always include time to create art on your own. Explore as many mediums as you can – painting with oil, watercolor, acrylics; drawing with pencil, crayon, charcoal, computer software; try ceramics, sculpture, photography, fine art video and more. Participate in or attend art exhibitions. Visit galleries and museums. Observe the world around you; notice the light, shadows, color, form, people, plants, shapes, everything. Take a close look at artworks you admire and figure out what the artist did to make it connect with you. Film: Watch everything you can: TV, movies, webisodes, social media videos, documentaries, experimental pieces, independent or mainstream, from the U.S. and all over the world. Write, write, write: Nothing happens in filmmaking if there isn’t something written first. Keep coming up with ideas for characters and situations. Look at the news for story ideas; listen to your friends and family; go out an explore the world so you can draw from your own experiences. Portfolios – Art or Film Whether for studio art (any medium) or film and video, start building your portfolio as soon as you can. Curate it – show only your best work, not everything you’ve ever done. Take advantage of college portfolio reviews where you can get one-on-one advice and a clearer idea of what that college is looking for. Many colleges want to see a range of topics and mediums, and some like to see series. They want to see who you are as an artist. Be sure to check out the portfolio requirements before you send in your oeuvre. Be Application Savvy Each performing or visual arts school may require a different repertoire or number of pieces/mediums in a portfolio, and many schools have an intricate set of deadlines for the university admission application and for the audition/portfolio application. Take time to read all of the fine print. Take notes and keep the information about your different schools organized. If the audition requires three pieces and you bring two, the admission committee may not regard your application as highly as they would those who prepared the required three pieces. If something isn’t clear or you want more information, call or email the college’s admission office well in advance of audition days or deadlines. Ask Questions–Lots of Questions Arm yourself with info. How often do students perform, double major, have internships, gallery shows, film fests, opportunities for community engagement? In addition to training in the arts, what kind of entrepreneurship training is available? Are there classes in which you learn how to market yourself, create your own arts venture, build an audience? Is there space for you to put your gear in the school, or do you have to haul everything all over campus? How much access do students have to the faculty? When you zero in on which schools you really want, go visit them. Talk to current students, get a tour, observe a class. Pick up the vibe. Does the school feel right to you? Take Advantage of College Resources If you ask a few weeks in advance, many colleges can arrange for you to observe a class, attend ensemble rehearsals, do free portfolio reviews or see performances by students and faculty. Oftentimes, colleges also bring in high-profile guest speakers and allow the public to attend. Colleges are brimming with activity in your field – check it out, get involved and enjoy a taste of college life! Now is your time to get prepared. Go for it! Want more info?

Bush Presidential Center Prospective Students Current Students Alumni Information for Faculty & Staff Apply to SMUGIVE NOW Meadows School of the Arts Areas of Study Admissions About Menu Search Undergraduate Admission Undergraduate Scholarships & Financial Aid Meadows Financial Aid Application Process Meadows Financial Aid Application Process Undergraduate Scholarships & Financial Aid Meadows Financial Aid Application Process Dual Admit Financial Package Ranges Meadows FAFSA/CSS Waiver SMU Scholarships and Financial Aid 1. Apply to SMU and Meadows Apply to SMU and complete any required audition or submit any required portfolio via the Meadows Application. Consult the specific admission checklist for your area for guidelines on when to apply and audition/submit your portfolio. 2. Review Guidelines on when to submit FAFSA and CSS Profile Dual Admit students (Art, Dance, Film and Media Arts [BFA], Music and Theatre) should be sure to submit your FAFSA and CSS profile by January 15. Please note that Meadows artistic scholarships will be determined after all candidates in each Meadows division have been reviewed for admission. Therefore, admitted students should expect final scholarship and financial aid packages between mid-March and early April. Students pursuing degrees in Advertising, Art History, Corporate Communication and Public Affairs, Creative Computing, Fashion Media, Film and Media Arts (BA), Journalism, and Public Relations and Strategic Communication should submit FAFSA and CSS profile by November 1 if applying Early Action or Early Decision I. If applying Regular Decision or Early Decision II, submit the FAFSA and CSS profile by January 15. Not applying for need-based aid? If you do not intend to apply for need-based financial aid, you must submit the Meadows Waiver Form. Trying to decide whether or not to apply for financial aid? The University's Division of Enrollment Services advises that a family income above $350,000 with one child in college is the approximate limit for need-based aid consideration. 3. Submit FAFSA and CSS Profile. Include SMU's school code on your submissions: 6660 (CSS Profile) and 003613 (FAFSA). To help streamline the submission process, use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool to complete the FAFSA. Double check that information on the FAFSA and CSS Profile match. Monitor your email for any additional documents that the SMU Office of Financial Aid may request. FAFSA and CSS Profile forms must be completed every year. FAFSA and CSS Profile are not required for international student applicants. 4. REVIEW the Scholarship/Financial Aid NOTIFICATION TIMELINEs: Academic merit scholarships Students will be notified of any SMU academic merit scholarship they have received with their university admission decision. Artistic merit scholarships Meadows artistic merit scholarships are determined beginning in mid-March, with the bulk of awards being communicated at the end of March/early April. Only students who have been admitted to Meadows and the University with completed FAFSA and CSS Profile forms OR a completed Meadows Waiver Form are considered for artistic scholarships. Notification of artistic scholarships is via email. Meadows Scholar Program Invitations Applicants who have indicated an interest in a Meadows major on their SMU application or submitted a Meadows application and demonstrate strong academic performance in high school are considered for the Meadows Scholar Program. Finalists are notified via email in March.

If you left on probation, you will return on probation. All holds must be cleared prior to enrollment. Returning students are responsible for meeting all financial aid, housing and advising deadlines. After nonattendance for two regular (fall, spring) terms, students who formerly attended are required to apply for reactivation. Students who were suspended from SMU must apply for reinstatement. If you intend to return to SMU, regardless of whether you are required to apply for reinstatement, you are encouraged to notify the appropriate University departments as soon as possible to ensure timely processing of enrollment, financial aid, housing and other documents. Transcripts If you attended any college or university after leaving SMU, you must forward official transcripts from each college or university attended since your last enrollment at SMU. If five years or more have elapsed since your last term of enrollment at SMU, you must also forward official transcripts from each college or university attended prior to SMU to the Division of Enrollment Services. Transfer courses from another institution Once you have matriculated at SMU, you may transfer up to 30 hours to SMU from an accredited, four year institution. Any course to be transferred must have the prior approval of the chair of the department and dean of the school at SMU that normally offers the course, the adviser and the student's dean. You must obtain these approvals before taking any such courses. Petitions to attend another college or university during the summer must be completed and approved in advance to ensure that proper credit is awarded.

They typically come to SMU with a strong sense of what they want to study and learn from our amazing faculty. They also come from diverse backgrounds and bring incredible experiences to campus, truly enriching student life here at SMU! Favorite place on campus: Dallas Hall. In the fall of 1915, when SMU’s first opened, Dallas Hall was the center of the university, housing a bookstore, soda fountain, grill, and a barber shop, in addition to offices, classrooms, and the library. Now that campus has expanded, it is now home to the famous university seal, classrooms, and offices. And on a clear day you can see all of Dallas from the steps of the building!Favorite place in Dallas: I love the Dallas Arboretum and Botanical Gardens! It is a beautiful place to visit any time of year!What I recommend during your stay in Dallas: If you happen to visit in October I would highly recommend that you visit the State Fair of Texas, conveniently located in Fair Park just a short drive from campus. Outside of October, you can get an amazing appreciation of the Dallas Skyline by walking the Margaret Hunt Hill Bridge and after your walk, you can visit Trinity Groves our Restaurant Concept Incubator. #RuralCommunity Admission Staff Claire Aherns Dante Branch Sydney Castle Jeremy Brown Anna Lee Buehn Joe Davis Ayah Krisht Joe Francisco Brenda Del Rio Rick Diaz Kim Herman Elena D.

SMU is its own little oasis in the heart of Dallas, Texas. Nothing I love more than taking time in between meetings to take a walk around campus! You will always see friendly faces, and nothing beats the views when the leaves begin to change in the fall! Favorite place on campus: My favorite place on campus has to be Hughes-Trigg! I love getting to see students and faculty grabbing a bite to eat in between classes. There is always something going on and it’s the best place to meet up with friends and colleagues on campus! Don’t forget to grab an Icee from The Market! Favorite place in Dallas: When I am not at work you can find me at Griggs Park in Uptown! It is one of my favorite views of downtown Dallas. I also love all the puppies there! Favorite restaurant near campus: Dallas has some really wonderful restaurants, so it’s hard to pick! My top three would have to be Oishii, Honor Bar, and E Bar Tex-Mex! What I recommend during your stay in Dallas: You have to check out the Knox Street area – so many shops and restaurants in the area. Make sure to stop by Knox Bistro or RH Rooftop!

Imagine spending the next few years of your life in the heart of the best city in the world (Dallas, Texas); I love how the students have access to art, culture, commerce and innovation at their fingertips. I can only imagine discovering new knowledge not only for the sake of your GPA, but also to improve your intellectual skills and create a meaningful impact on society. I am also impressed by the fact that SMU attracts a diverse student body from all over the United States as well as from abroad. SMU students are trailblazers in their own right. Undergraduates at SMU are driven to pursue their passions and dreams by taking the path less traveled. Above all, SMU students are empowered to maximize their potential. Favorite place on campus: A Saturday night football game at Gerald J. Ford Stadium is one of my favorite things to do in Dallas, as I am a huge football fan. The next time you are in town on a Saturday night, do yourself a favor and attend a game at Ford Stadium. Favorite place in Dallas: A great place to stop and relax as you make your way through downtown Dallas is Klyde Warren Park. The beautiful public park is a place of respite tucked in the middle of the downtown streets and high-rise buildings. On any given day, you can enjoy food trucks, outdoor dining, green space, public art and a casual social scene. Favorite restaurant near campus: Café 43. Lunch at this restaurant is of the highest quality. Unfortunately, they do not serve dinner. It is my favorite. It is ideal for business lunches. The service is excellent, the food is delicious and the atmosphere is amazing. What I recommend during your stay in Dallas: There are a number of places that families can visit during their stay in Dallas, including the Dallas World Aquarium, the Perot Museum of Nature and Science and the Dallas Zoo. One of the most popular family-friendly attractions in Dallas is the Dallas Arboretum and Botanical Garden, which is known for its unique seasonal displays. If you are interested in history, you might also want to visit the Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza, Pioneer Plaza, the George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum or Deep Ellum, one of the city’s first commercial districts that is now a hub for art, dining and live entertainment and is filled with free activities.

Bush Presidential Center Current Students Alumni Information for Faculty & Staff Apply to SMUGIVE NOW Undergraduate Admission Apply Visit Financial Aid Menu Search Find your admission counselor Admission Staff Sydney Castle Sydney Castle Admission Counselor 214-768-2058 sydneycastle@smu.edu Schedule a virtual 1:1 Year I Joined the Office of Admission: 2020 (as an ambassador) 2023 (as a counselor) Favorite thing about SMU: One of the most distinctive and remarkable aspects of SMU that differentiates us from other universities is the structure of our student organizations. A prominent example is the Student Foundation, which stands as the largest programming organization on our campus, responsible for coordinating significant events like Homecoming and Family Weekend. Unlike most other colleges and universities that rely on full-time staff to organize such events, SMU empowers its students by granting them the opportunity and autonomy to plan our most cherished traditions. This hands-on, real-life experience is exceptionally rare and provides students with invaluable learning opportunities; and at SMU, there is an abundance of such enriching experiences readily available. The organizations I was involved in as a student not only played a pivotal role in shaping me as an individual but also gave me a family. Favorite place on campus: When I first came to SMU, I had the opportunity to interview for the Hunt Scholarship, which took place in Harold Clark Simmons Hall. Following the interview, I came across the area near the back entrance of Fondren Library, where there are benches and pods of flowers. I sat on one of the benches to call my mom and tell her all about the interview. After about an hour, it was clear to both of us that I had fallen in love with SMU and I HAD to spend the next four years of my life here. Every time I pass this spot, I always think back to the moment I knew this was going to be my home. Favorite place in Dallas: Choosing just one favorite is impossible, but two of my favorite places are Barley House and Louie Louie’s Piano Bar. Barley House, conveniently located across the street from school, became our weekend haven, where my friends and I spent hours catching up, cheering for sports games, and supporting our talented musician friends who created a band and sometimes performed there. On the other hand, Louie Louie’s is located in Deep Ellum and the audience requests songs to sing along to until the early hours of the morning. These unforgettable moments really shaped my experience in Dallas. Favorite restaurant near campus: There are so many new restaurants that have popped up near campus since I first came to SMU that I absolutely love, like DL Mack’s and Ramble Room. However, when it comes to my ultimate favorite, I have to go with Banditos. In college, Banditos became the go-to place for my friends and me, no matter the occasion or mood. If we were happy, we would go there to celebrate, and we would also go if we needed a “pick me up” because the vibes simply cannot be beat! Banditos has a very special place in my heart. What I recommend during your stay in Dallas: Highland Park Village is an absolute must-see, particularly at night when the lights illuminate the trees. There are fabulous restaurants that are worth going to, such as Honor Bar, Mi Cocina, Fachini and Lounge 31. While you’re exploring the area, I highly recommend taking a stroll along the Katy Trail, immersing yourself in the charming atmosphere of the Knox/Henderson area, and driving around the neighborhoods that surround campus. As an SMU student, you are truly fortunate to be situated in such a beautiful and safe residential environment. Students definitely take advantage of having an abundance of remarkable restaurants, charming cafes and unique shops at your fingertips, making your college experience all the more enriching and enjoyable.

Pony up! Favorite place on campus: The Dedman Center for Lifetime Sports. Not because I’m using the state-of-the-art workout facilities or beautiful pools, but because it houses the brand-new Starbucks! Favorite place in Dallas: My favorite place in Dallas is the Bishop Arts neighborhood. It is incredibly diverse, multicultural and funky. On one corner, I can get amazing pupusas from a small El Salvadorian restaurant and on the next corner eat at one of the many delicious, incredibly creative restaurants where all the Dallas foodies go! Favorite restaurant near campus: So many great options-- but I'll go with the Dallas-based, Velvet Taco! They take traditional street tacos and add their own creative global spin. From the traditional Mexican flavors, to Southern, to Indian, and beyond. Definitely don't miss out on their delicious sides. My favorites are their Elote Corn and their loaded Crisp Tots with Local Egg-- it's all so delicious! What I recommend during your stay in Dallas: Check out the Arts District. There you’ll find the Dallas Museum of Art (which is awesome and, best of all, free!), the Nasher Sculpture Center (incredibly unique collection of contemporary and modern sculptures), and Klyde Warren Park (a very cool, large park which sits above one of Dallas’ busiest highways and has delicious food trucks!).

From the moment I first stepped onto the Boulevard, I knew SMU was the place for me. This place is beautiful, and I love being here when all the students are outside enjoying it. Each undergraduate college has its own personality and vibe. I love walking into Meadows to catch a glimpse of dress rehearsal performances. Dedman College is a classic on campus, but don’t get caught stepping on the seal in Dallas Hall! Rumor has it, you won’t graduate in 4 years. Cox conversations are my favorites to observe. Lyle’s innovation and technology on display inspire me to think about the future; and with education being my favorite subject, it’s hard for me not to find a kindred spirit at Simmons. It’s so much fun being on campus and experiencing it all over again. Favorite place on campus: That’s a tough one, but I’d have to say the Meadows School of the Arts. The college just finished a 2.5 year renovation and the space is spectacular! The talent housed in Meadows is off the charts! I love walking the halls and hearing vocal and instrumental warmups. The art on display is incredible! And the students…I don’t think there are a cooler group of people on campus! Favorite place in Dallas: My family and I love birds and wildlife. The John Bunker Sands Wetland Center is a short drive just outside of the city but the perfect escape from the hustle and bustle. It’s less than 30 minutes from campus. Check it out! Favorite restaurant near campus: I LOVE so many; it’s hard to choose! When in Texas, I believe it’s criminal not to experience Tex Mex. Rusty Taco has the best breakfast tacos in town! What I recommend during your stay in Dallas: Dallas has great shopping, restaurants, and art! I’d say spend the morning at the Nasher Sculpture Gardens, enjoy lunch at the Klyde Warren Park food trucks, and head over to Highland Park Village for some afternoon shopping.

Dallas doesn’t exist because of SMU, and SMU doesn’t exist because of Dallas. We have a great symbiotic relationship that opens students up to all the benefits of being in a big city, but you’re not going to class right in the middle of downtown. As an SMU student, you get the benefits of living on a residential campus in residential area, but the hustle and bustle of downtown is only minutes away. Between job and internship opportunities, entertainment venues, and opportunities to serve the community, this relationship allows our students to experience the best of both worlds in terms of campus location. Favorite place on campus: Moody Coliseum, without a doubt. When Moody was renovated in 2014, it reopened to a packed house of fans and a landslide Mustang victory of the U-Conn Huskies. I am a huge basketball fan, and the level of detail involved in the interior of Moody is awesome. It’s a great place to watch a basketball game: there’s not a bad seat in the house, it gets really loud really quickly, and the energy during games is unmatched. I try not to miss a single game! Favorite place in Dallas: The AT&T Performing Arts Center is among my favorite places in Dallas. Between the national tours that come to the Winspear Opera House to Meadows at the Meyerson (where our talented SMU Meadows student perform in the Meyerson Symphony Center), there are so many incredible performances that take place in this top-notch collection of performing arts venues. You’ll find yourself on the north end of the Dallas arts district and right in the midst of some incredible restaurant options, too. Favorite restaurant near campus: Definitely Campisi’s on Mockingbird. Campisi’s is a Dallas staple that’s been around since 1946. They have an awesome menu of Italian food, but their pizza is my favorite. Instead of traditional mozzarella, Campisi’s uses smoked provolone as their cheese of choice on their pizzas. You will 100% smell like pizza when you leave, but it’s absolutely worth it. (When in doubt, go for the Italian sausage and salami for your pizza toppings!) What I recommend you do during your stay in Dallas: In one word, explore! One of the best things about Dallas is that there are a ton of different neighborhoods with a ton of different things to do and see. I would encourage you to check out the Bishop Arts District, Deep Ellum, Knox/Henderson, White Rock Lake… do it all! There’s truly something for everyone in Dallas, whether you’re into music, shopping, local venues, or national names.

When I first moved onto campus my freshman year, I didn’t know anyone. This excited me as I attended college out of state specifically for this experience, but when my parents left, reality definitely started to settle in. However, I didn’t have time to even start to get nervous before my residential commons hosted the largest water balloon fight I had ever been a part of. By the end of my first day, I had an entire group of budding friendships with people I still talk to today, four years later. Home is where the Hilltop is. Favorite place on campus: This is one of the hardest questions to answer, but I think I have to go with the Dallas Hall Lawn. When I was searching for colleges as a high school senior and narrowing down my options, one thing that became really important to me was my ability to picture myself walking around and living my daily life on campus. SMU topped every option on my list, and I truly think that was because of our Dallas Hall Lawn. Every day, without fail, students are studying together, walking their dogs, going on picnics, boulevarding, etc. In my mind, it’s SMU’s signature! Favorite place in Dallas: There is ALWAYS something to do in the Dallas Arts District. I’m a big art-lover, so I may be a little bit biased, but any time I bring a friend there, they beg me to take them back!! Lots of food and entertainment options, and the best part is…. it only takes 15 minutes to get there! What I recommend during your stay in Dallas: I have to use one of these questions to brag about the food scene in Dallas. Some of my favorite restaurants that are SMU student classics are: Penne Pomodoro in Snider Plaza, Mi Cocina in Highland Park Village, Il Bracco at the Preston Center, and HG Supply Co. on Greenville.

Everyone has a story and their own experience creating a unique and positive culture when they meet at SMU. Students can get involved from Day One, including more than 200 clubs and organizations to be a part of. Strong traditions and history, as well as the tremendous support of faculty, staff and our great alumni network help make SMU a great place to be. Also, the strong connection that SMU has with the city of Dallas – located just a few short miles from downtown, students have access to all of the amenities of a large city, including the arts, entertainment, restaurants, music, sports, great restaurants, and shopping. SMU truly is a hidden gem within the big city! Favorite place on campus: It’s difficult to pick just one favorite place because each building has its own personality and uniqueness, all while sharing the tradition and values of SMU. The architecture and landscape on campus is just beautiful, and if you’re an art-lover like myself, be sure to check out the Meadows Museum of Art, housing one of the largest collections of Spanish art outside of Spain. Favorite place in Dallas: My favorite place is seeing something new and different! Dallas offers so much and there’s always something to do, whether it’s the museums, beautiful parks, including running and biking trails and lakes (yes, there are great parks in and around the big city!), checking out a concert, attending a professional sports game (NBA-Mavs, WNBA-Wings, NHL-Stars, MLB-Rangers, NFL-Cowboys), cheering on the Mustangs on our campus, or visiting the State Fair of Texas in the Fall – there is so much on my list that I’m excited to explore every time I visit Dallas and am on campus! What I recommend during your stay in Dallas: Go check out the museums in and around the city, like the George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum (on campus!), the Perot Museum of Nature and Science and The Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza in downtown Dallas. The city offers the nation’s largest urban arts district downtown! Also, you’ll find great restaurants of all types, no matter what you’re craving. With so many amazing food options in the area – just ask anyone when you’re on campus and you’ll probably get a different delicious recommendation!

Whether you are a student looking for an education or a staff member for SMU, the opportunities to learn, grow, and experience new things is never ending. Everyone here wants to see each other succeed, and that kind of support is simply unmatched. Favorite place on campus: The Hughes-Trigg Student Center is definitely one of my favorite places to hang out in. Since it has been renovated, it has allowed our students to thoroughly enjoy some of the great things SMU has to offer, such as innovative study/meeting spaces and fantastic food options like Panera. I love seeing the students hard at work, hanging out with their friends, or making conversation with some of our Dining Services staff members. If there is any place that can best capture SMU’s vibe, it is the Hughes-Trigg Student Center! Favorite place in Dallas: As someone who was born and raised in Dallas, this is hard! But if I *have* to choose a place, it would probably be Fair Park, because it is home to the famous State Fair of Texas and Big Tex himself! Every year, Dallas is honored to host the Texas State Fair which has an incredible amount of activities and amusement rides- good luck getting to them all! By far the best thing about the Texas State Fair is the good people and GREAT food. What I recommend during your stay in Dallas: There are so many fun and unique things to do in Dallas, such as visiting Deep Ellum or the Perot Museum in the Arts District. What I definitely recommend is visiting the Dallas Arboretum and Botanical Gardens. Whether you want to snap a pic for social media or simply immerse yourself into all of the beauty nature has to offer, the Dallas Arboretum is absolutely stunning and a people-pleaser for all ages. It is always worth a visit regardless of what time of year it is- it even has the Martha Stewart stamp of approval! #Bilingual #FirstGen Admission Staff Claire Aherns Dante Branch Sydney Castle Jeremy Brown Anna Lee Buehn Joe Davis Ayah Krisht Joe Francisco Brenda Del Rio Rick Diaz Kim Herman Elena D.

Yes I am biased in that my niece is a junior majoring in Civil Engineering. But, she is just one of the hundreds of students from southern California that have embraced the spirit of SMU and have made SMU such a great place. SMU students are awesome and make SMU truly unique among universities world-wide. Favorite place on campus: The Meadows Museum of Art allows me to step through the portals of time and place. Walking through the museum, you get a sense of history and culture. I could easily spend hours surrounded by the masterpieces housed there. Favorite place in Dallas: The Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza chronicles the assassination and legacy of President John F. Kennedy. Taking the tour is a moving experience and you will forever be affected by this historic place. Favorite restaurant near campus: Gloria’s on Greenville Avenue is not to be missed. Once you step inside, the smells transport you to place of pure gastronomic delight. This is not your typical Latin American eatery. The food is authentic and savory. I highly recommend the Sopa de Siete Mares. What I recommend during your stay in Dallas: If you are reading this, you are most likely from southern California. Go to the NorthPark Mall and listen to the conversations around you. While some of the words may be different with a “y’all” or two thrown in, the topics are no different than the ones you would hear at your local mall. Feel comfortable in the similarities and embrace the differences. And if you start to feel like it is too far from southern California – stop by the nearest In-N-Out for a double-double and a chocolate shake. By the way, there are 16 In-N-Out Burgers in the Dallas Metroplex area and one a mile from campus.

They typically come to SMU with a strong sense of what they want to study and learn from our amazing faculty. They also come from diverse backgrounds and bring incredible experiences to campus, truly enriching student life here at SMU! Favorite place on campus: Dallas Hall. In the fall of 1915, when SMU’s first opened, Dallas Hall was the center of the university, housing a bookstore, soda fountain, grill, and a barber shop, in addition to offices, classrooms, and the library. Now that campus has expanded, it is now home to the famous university seal, classrooms, and offices. And on a clear day you can see all of Dallas from the steps of the building!Favorite place in Dallas: I love the Dallas Arboretum and Botanical Gardens! It is a beautiful place to visit any time of year!What I recommend during your stay in Dallas: If you happen to visit in October I would highly recommend that you visit the State Fair of Texas, conveniently located in Fair Park just a short drive from campus. Outside of October, you can get an amazing appreciation of the Dallas Skyline by walking the Margaret Hunt Hill Bridge and after your walk, you can visit Trinity Groves our Restaurant Concept Incubator. #RuralCommunity Admission Staff Claire Aherns Dante Branch Sydney Castle Jeremy Brown Anna Lee Buehn Joe Davis Ayah Krisht Joe Francisco Brenda Del Rio Rick Diaz Kim Herman Elena D.

Everyone is truly happy and proud to be a part of SMU; it shows daily whether it’s inside the classroom, out and about on campus, or within the nearby businesses and neighborhoods. In a city that’s as large as Dallas, it truly makes you feel at home and have a sense of community on the Hilltop. Favorite place on campus: My favorite place on campus would have to be the Hughes-Trigg Student Center. This is a hub of student life on campus. From housing student organizations and offices, meeting rooms for organizations to meet or students to study, and housing my favorite place – Chick-fil-A, it’s truly buzzing with activity always. Favorite place in Dallas: I would have to say my favorite place in Dallas is the Lower Greenville district. Full of restaurants, local shops, bakeries and more, Lower Greenville is a great way to escape the true hustle and bustle of Dallas and move at a slower place with a great atmosphere. Favorite restaurant near campus: I would have to say my favorite restaurant near campus is Rusty Taco. Only three minutes away from campus, Rusty Taco is a staple in the Dallas area. Offering a variety of delicious taco options, they have something for everyone. I would recommend going for one of the breakfast tacos; a win every time! What I recommend during your stay in Dallas: During your stay in Dallas, I would recommend checking out Klyde Warren Park. Located in downtown Dallas, Klyde Warren Park is an outdoor park that goes over one of our Dallas freeways! It’s a great place to hang out outside and have a picnic or enjoy food from one of the various food trucks, and only a three-minute walk from the Dallas Museum of Art.

SMU is special, and I hope you visit campus to feel it! I came here from a large public university in Florida, where close community felt unattainable. You’re never a number at SMU, and you aren’t lost in crowds. Professors care about you, including enriching Faculty-in-Residence who live in Residential Commons. I’m the first person in my family to go to college, so I’m especially proud of SMU’s First-Generation Initiative. Favorite place on campus: I love our abundant fountains, plus the tanning pool outside of the Dedman Center for Lifetime Sports—where you’ll find a climbing wall, pool, gyms, indoor track, sports courts and more. But my favorite spot is the Wave sculpture outside the phenomenal Meadows Museum of Art. It’s a moving, undulating, kinetic sculpture above a reflecting pool. An engineering wonder! Favorite place in Dallas: Pelican Point at White Rock Lake! This gorgeous spot is perfect for when you’re homesick for Georgia’s Chattahoochee or Lake Lanier, or if you’re a paddleboarding Floridian like me who loves beautiful sunsets over calm water. Watch the sailboats sharing waves with pelicans, swans, and ducks. Head to the lake to study, run, bike, and find serenity in quiet nature. Favorite restaurant near campus: Desperados is a fantastic Tex-Mex restaurant close to campus. It’s an authentic family-run restaurant rooted in showcasing the culinary diversity of Mexico, while also serving untraditional twists and modern favorites like their famous Desperados Tacos. To satisfy your sweet tooth, stop by Chocolate Secrets—a dessert gem that offers handmade gourmet chocolates and lively open mic nights. What I recommend during your stay in Dallas: Go downtown to see the Giant Eye—the weirdest but coolest eyeball sculpture you’ve ever seen. Keep walking down Elm Street to the Grassy Knoll and Dealey Plaza, the historic site of JFK's assassination. The depth and diversity of Dallas will be on full display! Scan the city skyline and picture your future at SMU—you want to choose a city and university that feels like home. #FirstGen Admission Staff Claire Aherns Dante Branch Sydney Castle Jeremy Brown Anna Lee Buehn Joe Davis Ayah Krisht Joe Francisco Brenda Del Rio Rick Diaz Kim Herman Elena D.

You have that close-knit community feeling that a smaller campus can bring, while also benefiting from the sports, extra-curriculars, and school spirit of a larger school. Favorite place on campus: The Fondren Library would have to be my favorite. There are so many different kinds of spaces that can fit whatever kind of workspace you may need. Not to mention, there is a Starbucks inside so you can easily grab that caffeine boost you may need. Favorite place in Dallas: As a Dallas native, I love the Vickery Meadow area (just northeast of campus) for a nice and simple Saturday afternoon. There’s an Alamo Drafthouse movie theater, a Topgolf location, the Park Lane shopping center, and the Half-Price Books flagship location. In addition to that, there are many great local restaurants that are not to be missed. I would recommend Keller’s Hamburgers for that drive-in experience or Mariano’s Hacienda Ranch for delicious Mexican food. What I recommend during your stay in Dallas: Definitely make time to go on the M-Line Trolley. It travels through parts of downtown and a lot of Uptown, and it’s just a neat way to get to know the city. The best part – it’s free! #Bilingual #FirstGen Admission Staff Claire Aherns Dante Branch Sydney Castle Jeremy Brown Anna Lee Buehn Joe Davis Ayah Krisht Joe Francisco Brenda Del Rio Rick Diaz Kim Herman Elena D.

You get an amazing city feel and benefits without the overwhelming feeling of being in the city. Being in Dallas provides many opportunities for students. Favorite Place on Campus: While there are so many places to love at SMU, my favorite places are the Dedman Center for Lifetime Sports and the Historic Main Quad! There is so much to do in the Dedman Center such as swimming, rock climbing, and workout. It is a great place to get active in the comfort of your campus. The architecture and landscape on campus are so beautiful and a great way to run into students while enjoying The Texas sun! Favorite Place in Dallas: My favorite place in Dallas is American Airlines center, it is great from anything from seeing your favorite artist to watching the Mavs!

There is really a great sense that it’s a family of current student, alums, faculty and staff. I could be walking through any airport in the country and I will always get a “Go Mustangs!” or alums will show their pony pride with their “Pony Up” hand signal. Favorite place on campus: As a supporter of the arts, I love spending time in the Meadows Museum of Art. An oasis of Spanish Culture, it’s amazing that our students have these types of resources at their fingertips. If you are planning on visiting campus and want to check it out, keep in mind they are closed on Mondays. Favorite place in Dallas: Sitting behind the goal on the South Plaza of the American Airlines Center cheering on the Dallas Stars, the NHL franchise. Plus on occasion SMU students and staff get great discounts on tickets. Favorite restaurant near campus: Half-Shells in Snider Plaza. Coming from the East Coast I love great seafood and Half-Shells is a great place to get my fix. What I recommend during your stay in Dallas: If you have an extra half day head out to the Dallas Arboretum, this is a great oasis just 3 miles away from campus and overlooks White Rock Lake. If you catch it at the right time you might see our women’s crew team practicing!

Being on campus, you get the sense of how close of a community there is here. Everyone is welcoming and always willing to help. Favorite place on campus: My favorite place on campus has to be Dallas Hall and especially the views outside of the front doors. Dallas Hall is majestic on the inside and takes you back in time because of the historical significance of this building. I imagine the first students of SMU walking to their classes, and it is such a neat feeling. Also, when standing outside the front doors, you get the best view of the campus and the city of Dallas. Favorite place in Dallas: My favorite place in Dallas is White Rock Lake. It is a great place to be outdoors and enjoy some nature while living in the rush of the city. I like to go kayaking and take long walks there to disconnect and get some nice exercise for the week. Favorite restaurant near campus: My favorite restaurant near campus is Velvet taco! I like that they have fusion tacos that allow you to try something new. Of course, you have to try the tater tots too! What I recommend during your stay in Dallas: As a Dallas native, there is so much I can recommend! Dallas has some unique neighborhoods like Deep Ellum and Bishop Arts to explore. Also, there are so many great places to eat. Check out the Trinity Groves area for a diverse lineup of restaurants. I am also a huge Dallas sports fan; if you have the time, go to a Mavs game or Texas Rangers game.

FAQs | Undergraduate Test-Optional Policy Skip to main content SMU Explore SMU Academics Student Affairs About SMU News Events Calendar Research George W. Bush Presidential Center Current Students Alumni Information for Faculty & Staff Apply to SMUGIVE NOW Undergraduate Admission Apply Visit Financial Aid Menu Search Undergraduate Admission Apply FAQs | Undergraduate Test-Optional Policy FAQs | Undergraduate Test-Optional Policy Apply First Year U.S. Military Veterans International Students Transfer Forms and Applications Readmission Graduate Studies FAQs | Undergraduate Test-Optional Policy Student Resources Submitting Test Scores How long is the test-optional policy in place? SMU is currently fully test-optional. How do I know if I should submit my test scores or not? Admission and scholarship decisions are based on many factors including information from applicants’ high school transcript, personal essay, letters of recommendation, and record of personal achievements in addition to SAT or ACT scores. Under this policy, applicants who choose not to submit ACT or SAT scores will be evaluated on the other factors. Do you superscore standardized test scores? For those who choose to submit scores, SAT and ACT scores are superscored. Self-reported test scores are also accepted. If I choose to self-report test scores, will I be able to report one specific section of the SAT or ACT? For self-reported scores, provide scores for each section of the exam. Partial scores will not be considered. If I submit test scores will I be looked at more favorably than those who do not? No preference is given to applicants who submit or do not submit test scores. Grade/GPA-Related Questions If my grades were impacted by COVID-19, what should I do? All application materials are looked at in context. Many students have seen their academic record impacted by COVID-19, and items will be viewed through that lens. What if my school uses Pass/Fail grades during the Spring 2020 semester? Pass/Fail grades or any other official grading system submitted by your school will be considered in our admission review. If I do not submit test scores, will you put more weight on my GPA? Without test scores, all other elements of your application become more important, including grades, résumé, essays and recommendation letters. Extracurricular Activities My extracurricular activities have been put on hold because of COVID-19, how will they be evaluated during the admission process since many were cancelled? It is understood that most extracurricular activities will be affected in the foreseeable future, and the potential gap in activities will not affect admission to SMU. Cox School of Business If I do not submit test scores, will I be considered for admission to the Cox School of Business? Yes, the Cox School of Business will review all students who list business as an academic interest/major on their application. Scholarship Consideration If I choose not to submit my test scores, will it impact my ability/chances of receiving a merit award? No, academic merit scholarships are awarded to over half of the students in its entering class each fall. They range in value from $20,000 to $30,000 per year and more. These scholarships do not require a separate application and will also follow a test-optional process. If I take the SAT or ACT after I am admitted, can I submit those scores later for scholarship consideration? Yes, additional information for scholarship consideration can be submitted until the scholarship deadline date (typically January 15). If I choose not to submit my scores, how will that impact my ability/chances of receiving departmental scholarships? All students who apply to SMU and list an academic interest or major will be evaluated for departmental scholarships regardless of whether test scores are submitted or not. International Students I am an international student. Are you also waiving English proficiency requirements (e.g. TOEFL, IELTS, etc.)? Proof of English proficiency will still be required if your four years of high school education was not in English. Honors Programs If I do not submit test scores, will I be considered for the University’s honors programs? Yes, without standardized test scores, consideration for the University's honors program will still be given. Future Applicant - Entering SMU in 2023 and Beyond Will SMU consider going to test-optional in future years? At this time, SMU is fully test-optional. If I graduate in 2023 but decide to wait a year to apply to SMU, will this policy still apply to me? If a gap year is desired, apply for admission under the current test-optional policy and, if admitted, request a gap year. How will you review the second semester of my junior year? This is a challenging, uncertain time and SMU will continue to provide a truly holistic review of your application. It is the hope that all applicants will stay actively engaged in their academics to prepare for future academic success as well as for standardized testing. If schools go to a Pass/Fail system of grading (or credit/no credit), how will SMU review this during the application process? Many schools have planned to take this approach. There are no penalties for any adjustment to grading methodology during this period of time.

You may register during orientation, which you complete after you have applied and been admitted to SMU. Orientation is available for both incoming first year students and transfer students. How do I know what classes to take? Upon entering SMU, you will begin fulfilling two general sets of requirements necessary to graduate: the Common Curriculum that all students must satisfy regardless of major, and the requirements specified by the major itself. First-year students are assigned to an academic advisor from Dedman College. Your advisor will work with you regarding selection of classes. When can I see my academic advisor? You are assigned a professional advisor at orientation and are required to connect with him/her before registration each semester. You can also set up appointments on your own time throughout the semester. SMU provides students with a well-staffed, award-winning advising center of professional, full-time advisors. What exactly is a "liberal arts" curriculum? The liberal arts disciplines include the humanities, the natural and the mathematical sciences, and the social sciences. With a foundation in the liberal arts, the SMU student gets a complete education - as a professional in a chosen career, a citizen in the world of ideas, and a full-fledged participant in life itself. SMU's general requirements in the liberal arts (the Common Curriculum) provide students with an exceptional educational opportunity. How and when will I choose a major? SMU offers more than 100 undergraduate majors and 85 minors. Your academic advisor and many other support systems are available to help you choose your major. You will make this decision by the end of your sophomore year. May I declare my major during my first year? Upon entering SMU, you may declare your intended major. All students enter the university through Dedman College of Humanities and Sciences. You may not officially declare your major until you have successfully completed at least 24 hours and satisfied the entrance requirements for your intended major. Does SMU have an honors program? Yes. Students participating in the program will take 7-8 special courses within the University Curriculum which encourage deeper understanding through interdisciplinary thinking and learning. The honors program offers small, discussion-focused classes. Entrance is by invitation. What is the average class size at SMU? The average class size is 22. Seventy percent of our classes contain 25 students or less. Students don't get lost in large lecture courses conducted by graduate students. SMU students learn from senior faculty in small classes. What is the student-to-faculty ratio? 11:1. Classes are small enough to encourage close faculty-student interaction. Will graduate students teach most introductory classes? No. Almost all classes at SMU are taught by faculty, not graduate students. Will I have the opportunity to study abroad? Yes. SMU offers summer, semester and year-long opportunities to live, study and travel in foreign countries. SMU Abroad offers 148 programs in 50 countries. Will SMU send my grades to my parents? The Family Educational Rights to Privacy Act of 1974 states that no personally identifiable information from a student's record will be disclosed to a third party without prior written consent from the student. Grades may be released to parents if either the student completes a release form or the parent completes a Declaration of Dependency form. These releases are available in the Registrar's office. Once SMU has an approved release on file then the parent or student can request an official transcript.

All of our Residential Commons -- RC's for short -- are co-ed and offer the same amenities: mostly double-occupancy rooms with similar furnishings and access to classroom and study space and dining options. But, that's where the similarities end. Each architecturally distinctive building houses a community that is ever-evolving with each new group of residents, developing unique traditions, gatherings, and meaningful activities. Each RC even has its own signature crest and colors to further add to the individual identity of the community. Together, the 11 Commons make up a vibrant, dynamic residential living and learning system that reflects the diversity on which SMU thrives as a whole. Explore the Commons here. Faculty Engagement SMU’s commitment to creating lasting, mentoring relationships between students and faculty extends into the Residential Commons system with the Faculty in Residence. The FiRs are the cornerstone of the residential life experience, offering mentorship, guidance, intellectual discourse and fostering community outside of the classroom. Whether it’s teaching a class inside the RC, organizing a group outing to explore one of Dallas’ offerings such as Klyde Warren Park, or baking up a fresh batch of cookies for a weekly book club, FiRs are there to engage, interact and foster students through their first two years on campus. You may even get the opportunity to take walks with a furry resident, like Chewy, official Dog in Residence at Crum Commons!

From Move-In Day hustle and bustle and game-day Boulevarding to the Celebration of Lights cheer and Commencement excitement, milestones throughout the year are marked with unforgettable special festivities. From your first Family Weekend to your 50th Homecoming game, you’ll never stop being a Mustang. Motto The SMU motto is veritas liberabit vos, or, “The truth will make you free.” Chosen by SMU’s first president, the motto was adopted in 1912. It’s featured all across campus, including in the official SMU seal cast into the rotunda floor of SMU’s first building, Dallas Hall. Alma Mater Written by an SMU theology student in 1916 and set to words by SMU’s first band director in 1929, “Varsity” has been proudly sung at University events from Opening Convocation to Commencement to sporting events ever since. School Colors SMU’s official school colors are red and blue. Live Mascot SMU’s live mascot, Peruna IX, is a miniature Shetland pony named after an early 20th-century medicine, Peruna Tonic – which was said to have a kick. Mustang fans show school pride with pony ears during school songs, chants and cheers. Learn about the history of the nine Perunas here. Pony Ears We use our “pony ears” hand symbol for pretty much all occasions – when posing for a photo, cheering on the Mustangs or singing our school songs. To make them, start with a peace sign and let your first and middle fingers “relax” so that they’re slightly bent. If you’re singing the fight song, rock your hand back and forth with the music. When you find yourself on campus, bring your pony ears, too! Homecoming Every fall, the Mustang community gathers on the Hilltop to celebrate Homecoming. Students compete through their organizations in a variety of activities to win the day, alumni gather from across the street or around the globe to reconnect at reunion parties, families from surrounding neighborhoods come to watch the Homecoming parade, and all are encouraged to cheer on the ’stangs at Ford Stadium! The Boulevard At SMU, we like to say that we don’t tailgate – we Boulevard. Before home football games, you’ll find students, alumni and Mustang fans socializing up and down Bishop Boulevard. One alumna, Palmer Beldy ’22, shares her top tips for a successful Boulevard. The Hilltop More than a century ago, when our founders set out to find the place to lay the cornerstone of Dallas Hall, they chose the highest point on campus, from where you could look out upon the beautiful city of Dallas toward downtown and the prosperous future that was to come. From there, the nickname "the Hilltop" was born, and it’s the name by which we still refer to our tree-lined, 234-acre campus in the heart of one of the nation’s economic and cultural powerhouses. Events PerunaPalooza | SMU’s springtime festival celebrating Peruna’s birthday. Students enjoy games, rides and activities while helping themselves to a variety of carnival-inspired free food. Pigskin Revue | During Homecoming Weekend, Mustangs take part in our longest running tradition, the Pigskin Revue. Started in 1933, this variety show features acts from groups across the community – students, faculty and alumni. The Mustang Band is heavily featured as participants sing, dance and even take part in some stand-up comedy. Celebration of Lights | SMU and the surrounding communities gather for this joyous occasion to watch the famous Dallas Hall light up with thousands of lights. Guests gather on the Dallas Hall lawn for hot cocoa, cider and warm cookies and to hear holiday carols performed by SMU students. After SMU President R. Gerald Turner reads the Christmas Story, the special evening concludes with the singing of Silent Night and the lighting of SMU’s stunning Dallas Hall and surrounding trees. Tate Lecture Series | The lecture series brings to campus some of the world's most interesting and provocative speakers, including former presidents, commentators, futurists and artistic legends. The Tate Lecture Series annually returns almost $1 million in student scholarships to the University.

The payment plans allow you to pay your student tuition account charges in monthly installments with no interest charges. Payment plans cannot be applied to Miscellaneous account charges. Payment plans are available for Fall, Spring and Summer Terms. The plans are not available for Jan, May, and August Terms. Re-enrollment in a payment plan is required each term if you choose to participate. An open balance from a previous term cannot be added to a current payment plan. If you enroll in a payment plan for your final term at SMU, your diploma will be held until the payment plan is paid-in-full. However, you will be eligible to participate in the graduation ceremony. A down payment will be required if you enroll in a payment plan close to or after the first installment is due. Fall and Spring Payment Plans Payment plans do not automatically renew. Accordingly, for each term you wish to make monthly payments, you must enroll in a new payment plan. Six Month Payment Plan - This term plan permits payment in 6 installments: July 5 through December 5 for fall and January 5 through June 5 for spring. The non-refundable enrollment fee is $50 per term. The deadline to enroll in this payment plan is August 10 for fall and January 20 for spring.

Multiple payment plans per term are not permitted. The student or Authorized Payer who creates the payment plan will become the “Plan Owner”. Changes to the payment plan can be made by the student, Plan Owner, SMU and Nelnet Campus Commerce. Please note that changes made to the "Payment Method" (bank account or credit card information) can only be made by the Plan Owner. Follow the below instructions for enrollment information: Student Enrollment: Log into your my.SMU account Select the Financials tab from the left-hand menu Select SMUpay from the drop-down menu Select Payment Plan from the SMUpay left-hand menu Authorized Payer Enrollment: In order to enroll in a payment plan, your student must set you up as an Authorized Payer. Click here for instructions on How to Add an Authorized Payer. Once you are set up as an Authorized Payer, go to http://quikpayasp.com/smu/bursar/authorized.do. Enter Login Name and Password Click on Payment Plan in the QuikPay menu How to Make a Payment Toward a Payment Plan Automatic payment is required to enroll into a payment plan. Once payment plan is set up, manual payments should not be made to SMU unless payment plan does not cover SMU Student Account charges. Payments must be made via automatic deduction (ACH) from a regular United States checking or savings account or via credit/debit card (VISA, American Express, Discover and MasterCard). ACH payments are free of charge. Credit/debit card payments will be assessed a non-refundable 2.85% service fee per transaction (charged by Nelnet Campus Commerce). ACH payments are processed on the 5th or 20th of the month, depending on which payment plan you select. When the 5th or 20th falls on a weekend or holiday, ACH payments are processed the following business day. Dates and plan terms may be subject to change without notice. How to Calculate the Amount of your Payment Plan Before your Student Account Balance is Determined You can enroll in a payment plan prior to being fully enrolled by estimating the student account charges and deducting any anticipated financial aid. Once your charges and financial aid are determined, your payment plan can be adjusted by the student, Plan Owner, SMU and Nelnet Campus Commerce (refer to “How to adjust a payment plan” below). Please make sure that your SMU Student Account is fully covered by the SMU payment due date to avoid past due fees of 1.5% per month on any unpaid balance. We created an undergraduate student Cost Estimate Calculator to help you determine the amount of your payment plan total. How to Adjust a Payment Plan A key to a successful payment plan is budgeting correctly. If the payment plan is budgeted incorrectly, your payment plan must be adjusted. In this instance, your payment plan will need to be decreased if the plan exceeds actual costs. If your payment plan does not cover the actual cost, either the plan will need to be increased or a payment will need to be made to SMU for the remaining balance. Changes to the payment plan can be made by the student, Plan Owner, SMU and Nelnet Campus Commerce.

All applicants are considered automatically for academic scholarships. U.S. and dual citizens and permanent residents who submit the FAFSA and CSS PROFILE® are considered for need-based financial aid. The FAFSA will be used to determine federal and state aid eligibility, such as Pell Grant, Federal Direct Loans and Work Study. The CSS PROFILE® will be used to determine eligibility for SMU need based aid. Will I have a financial aid advisor at SMU? SMU assigns a financial aid advisor to each student. When do I apply for financial aid? Simply submit two forms by your chosen application deadline: November 1 for Early Decision I and Early action or January 15 for Early Decision II or Regular Decision.These are priority deadlines. Both forms will be available October 1, 2017. 1. The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for federal and state aid U.S. and dual citizens and permanent residents seeking eligibility for federal and state sources of aid must submit the FAFSA each year. Visit fafsa.gov to file the FAFSA. Use SMU school code 003613. 2. The CSS PROFILE® for institutional aid For SMU opportunity grants, you must submit a CSS PROFILE® financial application each year. This will give our financial aid advisors more information to further assess your financial need. There is a $25 cost for completing the CSS PROFILE®. Visit cssprofile.org to file the CSS PROFILE®. Use SMU school code 6660. How does SMU determine the amount of financial assistance? FAFSA and CSS PROFILE® information is sent to SMU, which compares the cost of attending SMU with the family’s ability to contribute to the cost. The FAFSA will be used to determine federal and state aid eligibility, such as Pell Grant, Federal Direct Loans and Work Study. The CSS PROFILE® will be used to determine eligibility for SMU need based aid. When will I receive my award notification? Most academic scholarships are awarded at the time of admission. For need-based awards, SMU must receive and review your FAFSA and CSS PROFILE® before your awards can be determined. What if I receive an off-campus scholarship? Let your financial aid advisor know of any expected scholarships from outside sources.

SMU offers a range of merit and leadership scholarships. These are based on competitive standing within the SMU class and are offered without regard to family financial circumstances. In order to apply, a student should submit his or her application for admission by January 15. There are no additional documents to submit other than the application for admission. However, the Hunt Leadership Scholarship requires a student to submit an additional essay outlined on the admission application. Visit smu.edu/huntapply for more information. What can I expect in the way of a scholarship? Applications that are received by January 15 are automatically considered for merit scholarships. Scholarship committees review all applications and award scholarships to many applicants. We do not publish the qualifications of the different scholarship levels because they are based on the applicant pool every year. The majority of merit scholarship awards are mailed with admission decisions. What types of scholarships does SMU offer? SMU offers academic-based and leadership-based scholarships. These options include, but are not limited to, the following: President's Scholars, Hunt Leadership Scholars, SMU Founders’ Scholars, Second Century Scholars, Cornerstone Scholarships, National Merit Scholarships, Mustang Scholars, Dedman College merit scholarships for first-year students and departmental awards for continuing studies, School of Engineering Honors Scholarship Program, Co-op Education Program, Meadows full and partial scholarships based on artistic merit, Athletic Scholarships, and Mustang Band Scholarships. We do not publish the qualifications of every scholarship level because they are based on the applicant pool each year. More information can be found on the Financial Aid website. Are there special scholarships for Methodist students? Methodist applicants receive the same consideration as all other students for SMU financial aid programs. They also can receive consideration for specifically dedicated programs. These include: The Methodist Student Loan Fund, Minister's Family Tuition Awards ($3,500/term), and United Methodist Scholarships (vary in amount). What kind of financial aid is available? A student who demonstrates financial need is awarded an aid "package" that combines SMU funds with governmental sources. Grants, low-cost loans, and part-time work opportunities typically appear in need-based packages. Middle- or upper-level income families who may not meet federal need standards can apply for family loan programs and extended payment plans. See the Financial Aid website for more information on Student Loans and Federal Work Study (Student Employment). Do I apply for financial aid before or after I apply for admission? File the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) as close to February 15 as possible for federal need-based aid consideration. The FAFSA application is available online at studentaid.gov. You also need to file the College Scholarship Service CSS Profile™ to further assess your financial need for need-based programs. This form can be found at student.collegeboard.org/profile. There is a $25 fee to file the CSS Profile™. After I file the FAFSA and CSS Profile™, how will I know if SMU has received my information? The federal processor will email you the Student Aid Report (SAR) on FAFSA information. If you listed SMU on your FAFSA and CSS Profile™, SMU will receive your information electronically. What kind of financial aid will I receive because I filed the FAFSA and CSS Profile™? You will be considered for all federal, state (Texas residents only), and SMU need-based funding. These programs are awarded on the basis of documented financial need and funding availability. When will I receive my financial aid award letter notification? Generally, award letters are mailed beginning March 15. SMU must receive and review your electronic FAFSA and CSS Profile™before mailing an award letter. What do I do after I receive my financial aid award letter? The award letter packet provides details regarding financial aid, as well as instructions on how to respond to SMU's offer. Please read and review the information and instructions carefully. If you have questions, contact your SMU financial aid advisor. How does SMU determine the amount of financial assistance? FAFSA and CSS Profile™information are sent to SMU, which compares the cost of attending SMU with the amount of money a family is estimated to still need after all state, federal, and scholarship money is factored in. Financial aid advisors begin packaging financial aid in March, starting with students who applied early. What are my chances of receiving financial aid? You need to apply to SMU and file a FAFSA and CSS Profile™to help the University determine eligibility for financial aid. We have no way of knowing your chances until you apply. SMU has many financial aid avenues, including options for middle-income families. What is the difference between grants and loans? Grants are gift aid and do not have to be repaid. Loans must be repaid. How will I receive the financial aid funds that are awarded? Before each term begins, the scholarships and grants are applied to your student account. If you have applied for and completed necessary loan processing, those funds will be applied each term to your student account when received from the lender. What should I do if I have a special financial circumstance (such as the loss of a job) since I filed my FAFSA and CSS Profile™? Contact your financial aid advisor to discuss any special or unusual circumstances. Are on-campus jobs available, and how do I get paid for working? Yes, there are many on-campus jobs available as part of work study (Student Employment). You will be paid every two weeks for the hours you work. Your work study earnings are not applied to your student account.

You will be considered automatically for these scholarships when you apply for admission. SMU has specific scholarships available for National Merit Scholars, International Baccalaureate Diploma candidates and many other scholarships for our top applicants. Additionally, Dedman College, Cox School of Business, Lyle School of Engineering, Meadows School of the Arts and Simmons School of Education and Human Development offer scholarships to selected students who express an interest in a major in those schools. The President’s Scholars Program President’s Scholarships are awarded to students who have shown exemplary academic skills, and is SMU's most prestigious merit-based scholarship. The award is full tuition and fees plus study abroad. Students who live on campus also receive a scholarship for room and board. For consideration, students must have exceptional achievement on the SAT or ACT and in their high school curriculum. The Nancy Ann and Ray L. Hunt Leadership Scholars Program Hunt Leadership Scholarships are awarded to students with extraordinary leadership qualities and strong academic performance. Students selected as Hunt Leadership Scholars for the Class of 2026 will receive an annual Hunt Scholarship of $46,000, or a total of $184,000 over four years. The award also includes airfare and tuition costs for any courses during an international, leadership-based experience immediately following each scholar's sophomore year. An additional essay is required. Click here to complete the online Hunt Leadership Scholars Application. Provost Scholarship, SMU Distinguished Scholarship, Second Century Scholarship, University Scholarship The Provost Scholarship, SMU Distinguished Scholarship, Second Century Scholarship and the University Scholarship are awarded to those students who have demonstrated outstanding academic success throughout high school – most importantly by presenting a combination of high school grades and standardized test scores that together place them among the top students applying to SMU each year. Students selected as a Provost, SMU Distinguished, Second Century or University Scholar are recognized as potential leaders in the classroom at SMU. This designation is based on information submitted in the application for admission and may be updated by sending additional SAT or ACT scores directly from The College Board or ACT, Inc. respectively. These scholarship offers are typically included in a student’s admission packet. International Baccalaureate (IB) Scholars Students who complete the IB Diploma Program will receive a $7,500 per academic year scholarship. This scholarship may be combined with other scholarship or grant aid from SMU, but in no case can the combination of institutional aid exceed Tuition and Fees for that academic year. Learn more about academic scholarships. Need-based Assistance Learn more about the financial aid process at SMU. Your financial situation is unique, so we offer a variety of options to meet your needs. These include SMU Opportunity Awards as well as state and federal sources of financial assistance, depending on financial need and residency. An undergraduate’s average need-based loan amount is $4,640 annually. Start Your Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) For U.S. and dual citizens and permanent residents to be eligible for federal and state sources of aid, the first step is to submit the FAFSA. You must complete a FAFSA each year for continued consideration for state and federal financial aid. List SMU as your school of choice on the FAFSA. SMU’s school code is 003613. Submit your FAFSA by January 15 for priority consideration for need-based awards. Start Your College Scholarship Service CSS Profile™ For SMU-funded aid, you also must submit a CSS Profile™ financial aid application to the College Board. This application will give our financial aid advisors more information to further determine your eligibility for university need-based aid. List SMU as your school of choice on the CSS Profile™, and use the code 6660. There is a $25 cost for completing the CSS Profile™. Submit your CSS Profile™ by January 15 for priority consideration for need-based awards. Dallas County Promise Scholarship The Promise Scholarship is awarded in partnership with the Dallas County Promise program to provide a college education to students graduating from eligible high schools in Dallas County.

SMU will select up to five (5) high school seniors to receive a two-year Promise Scholarship. This is a last-dollar scholarship (combined with other grants and scholarships) to provide full tuition and fees. Learn the full eligibility requirements and conditions here.

All outside scholarships will be split 50/50 between fall and spring semester unless otherwise instructed by the donor/foundation. If you are receiving some form of outside scholarship, download the Outside Scholarship Form (PDF) and submit it to the Office of Financial Aid & Scholarships. Student employment National studies show that college students who work part time benefit financially, sharpen their time management skills and are more likely to remain in school.

Selection is through a holistic review based on academic and extra-curricular achievement, financial need, and leadership potential as demonstrated throughout high school and in the application process. Eligibility Requirements: Apply to SMU as a first-year student by January 15 Graduate from a participating Dallas County Promise high school located in Dallas County (Texas) Texas residency Verified Pell Grant eligibility as defined by the FAFSA or the equivalent demonstrated need as defined by the TASFA Priority given to students with a cumulative “A” average (3.5 GPA on an unweighted 4.0 scale) in grades 9-12 Students must complete the requirements for the Dallas County Promise Path Students must complete their Associate degree after graduating from high school (Students graduating high school with an Associate degree or with a significant amount of dual credit are not eligible and can instead be considered for the Mustang Scholarship) Scholarship Conditions: Graduate from a Dallas County Promise eligible high school Complete an Associate of Arts or Associate of Science degree within two years of graduating from high school while earning a 3.500 cumulative GPA from a Dallas College school (Note: Associate of Applied Arts, Teaching (AT), and Associate of Applied Science degrees do not meet this requirement.)

Yes, applicants must meet all requirements (Dallas County Promise high school graduate, Texas resident, Pell-eligible, Dallas County Promise Path completed, no Associates degree earned in high school) in order to be considered. If I take dual credit classes in high school but do not earn an Associate degree, am I still eligible? No, unfortunately, we are looking for students with little to no dual credit earned in order to be reviewed for this particular scholarship, as this scholarship does require our students to attend Dallas College for a full two years after high school graduation. Admitted students with significant dual credit or an Associate degree will instead be automatically considered for our Mustang Scholarship or for our Access SMU award. If I am a current Dallas College student, can I be considered for the scholarship? Unfortunately, we only award the scholarship to first-year applicants. Students currently applying to transfer into SMU are not eligible to be reviewed for this scholarship, and should instead apply to the North Texas Community College Scholarship. Is there an income requirement in order to be considered? While there is no strict income requirement, you do need to be Pell Grant eligible in order to be considered. What is the CSS Profile, and is it required? Yes, the CSS Profile is required in order to be considered for this award (it is also required in order to be completely reviewed for SMU financial aid). It is very similar to the FAFSA; both FAFSA/TASFA and the CSS Profile should be submitted by January 15. If I submit my SMU application late, can I still be considered? Only students with completed applications by January 15 will be considered for this award.

From Move-In Day hustle and bustle and game-day Boulevarding to the Celebration of Lights cheer and Commencement excitement, milestones throughout the year are marked with unforgettable special festivities. From your first Family Weekend to your 50th Homecoming game, you’ll never stop being a Mustang. Motto The SMU motto is veritas liberabit vos, or, “The truth will make you free.” Chosen by SMU’s first president, the motto was adopted in 1912. It’s featured all across campus, including in the official SMU seal cast into the rotunda floor of SMU’s first building, Dallas Hall. Alma Mater Written by an SMU theology student in 1916 and set to words by SMU’s first band director in 1929, “Varsity” has been proudly sung at University events from Opening Convocation to Commencement to sporting events ever since. School Colors SMU’s official school colors are red and blue. Live Mascot SMU’s live mascot, Peruna IX, is a miniature Shetland pony named after an early 20th-century medicine, Peruna Tonic – which was said to have a kick. Mustang fans show school pride with pony ears during school songs, chants and cheers. Learn about the history of the nine Perunas here. Pony Ears We use our “pony ears” hand symbol for pretty much all occasions – when posing for a photo, cheering on the Mustangs or singing our school songs. To make them, start with a peace sign and let your first and middle fingers “relax” so that they’re slightly bent. If you’re singing the fight song, rock your hand back and forth with the music. When you find yourself on campus, bring your pony ears, too! Homecoming Every fall, the Mustang community gathers on the Hilltop to celebrate Homecoming. Students compete through their organizations in a variety of activities to win the day, alumni gather from across the street or around the globe to reconnect at reunion parties, families from surrounding neighborhoods come to watch the Homecoming parade, and all are encouraged to cheer on the ’stangs at Ford Stadium! The Boulevard At SMU, we like to say that we don’t tailgate – we Boulevard. Before home football games, you’ll find students, alumni and Mustang fans socializing up and down Bishop Boulevard. One alumna, Palmer Beldy ’22, shares her top tips for a successful Boulevard. The Hilltop More than a century ago, when our founders set out to find the place to lay the cornerstone of Dallas Hall, they chose the highest point on campus, from where you could look out upon the beautiful city of Dallas toward downtown and the prosperous future that was to come. From there, the nickname "the Hilltop" was born, and it’s the name by which we still refer to our tree-lined, 234-acre campus in the heart of one of the nation’s economic and cultural powerhouses. Events PerunaPalooza | SMU’s springtime festival celebrating Peruna’s birthday. Students enjoy games, rides and activities while helping themselves to a variety of carnival-inspired free food. Pigskin Revue | During Homecoming Weekend, Mustangs take part in our longest running tradition, the Pigskin Revue. Started in 1933, this variety show features acts from groups across the community – students, faculty and alumni. The Mustang Band is heavily featured as participants sing, dance and even take part in some stand-up comedy. Celebration of Lights | SMU and the surrounding communities gather for this joyous occasion to watch the famous Dallas Hall light up with thousands of lights. Guests gather on the Dallas Hall lawn for hot cocoa, cider and warm cookies and to hear holiday carols performed by SMU students. After SMU President R. Gerald Turner reads the Christmas Story, the special evening concludes with the singing of Silent Night and the lighting of SMU’s stunning Dallas Hall and surrounding trees. Tate Lecture Series | The lecture series brings to campus some of the world's most interesting and provocative speakers, including former presidents, commentators, futurists and artistic legends. The Tate Lecture Series annually returns almost $1 million in student scholarships to the University.

The United States government requires all international applicants to provide proof of ability to pay tuition and living expenses before SMU can issue the forms required to obtain a visa. This requirement applies both to international students coming from abroad and those transferring from another U.S. university or institution. For SMU to issue you a Form I-20, you will need to submit: 1. The International Student Financial Statement form. Section one and section two must be completed, including the signatures of both you (the student) and your sponsor. 2. A copy of the picture page from your passport 3. Original Financial Verification from Bank or Financial Institution, on bank letterhead, from you or your sponsor, must be dated within six months of the time of I-20 issuance. Account balance(s) must be shown in an amount greater than or equal to the total estimated costs below. - Any scholarship amount awarded by SMU can be submitted as part of the financial support documents. An example of the wording that can be used follows: “I hereby certify that according to our records, SPONSOR’S NAME, the sponsor of STUDENT’S NAME, is capable of meeting the $90,152 education expenses of the student as indicated on the Estimated Undergraduate Cost form." The bank letter must be translated into English and current balance in U.S. dollars. 4. If you are currently attending an institution in the US (college or high school), you will need to arrange for the release of your SEVIS record to SMU once your program is completed. Please complete our Transfer-In Form and upload it within the International Document Submission Form found on your Admission Status Page. The SMU International Student & Scholar Service Office will process your I-20 request after all required materials have been submitted to the SMU Office of Undergraduate Admission. Please expect approximately two weeks after your documents have been received for your Form I-20 to be processed. A digital copy of your Form I-20 will be e-mailed to you so you can make your visa appointments at the US Embassy near you. Estimated Undergraduate Costs The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) requires that all foreign passport holders planning to study in the United States verify that appropriate funds are available to pay for education, living, and other expenses. This verification is needed in order to process and issue the required I-20 document. The estimated expenses expected to be incurred during the 2023-2024 academic year are as follows: 2023-2024 Education, Living, and Other Expenses Estimated Cost Fall and Spring Tuition $57,212 Estimated General Student Fees $7,248 Housing (double room with roommate) and meal plan $18,230 Mandatory Health Insurance Purchased through SMU $3,786 International Fee $200 Books and Supplies $3,476 Total $90,152 USD Apply NowVisit UsBack to top Academics Cox School of Business Dedman College of Humanities and Science Dedman School of Law Lyle School of Engineering Meadows School of the Arts Moody School of Graduate and Advanced Studies Perkins School of Theology Simmons School of Education & Human Development SMU CAPE SMU Libraries SMU Guildhall Audience Links Undergraduate Students Graduate Students Alumni Faculty & Staff Media Parents Quick Links SMU Ignited: Boldly Shaping Tomorrow Corporate and Foundation Relations COVID-19 Information (Mustang Strong) Bush Center SMU Store Academic Calendar Academic Ceremonies Events Calendar Employment Giving to SMU Virtual Tour SMU Stories Get in Touch Contact Us Maps Directions Compliance Legal Disclosures Privacy Policy Statement Report Sexual Harassment Reporting a bias Incident HEERF Reporting Emergency Preparedness Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram LinkedIn YouTube © Southern Methodist University Apply First-Year Domestic Student* Application U.S. Military Veterans First-Year International Student* Application Transfer Forms and Applications Readmission to SMU Graduate Studies FAQs | Undergraduate Test-Optional Policy Student Resources Visit Virtual Campus Experience In-Person Visit Virtual Tour Admission Events Maps and Directions Residential Commons Tour Where to Stay Academics Majors and Minors Schools Faculty Virtual Connections Support and Resources Honors and Scholars Tips SMU Abroad SMU-in-Taos FAQs | Academics SMU Experience Visit SMU Activities and Organizations SMU & Dallas Dallas Experience Dining Diversity At SMU FAQs | Living on Campus FAQs | Student Life Fitness and Recreation Health and Safety Residence Life Spirit and Traditions Sports Spiritual Life Financial Aid Cost of Attendance Types of Aid Access SMU Financial Aid Process Payment Plan Options SMU Net Price Calculator Mustang Scholars Robert H.

5 Tips on How to Double Major - Meadows School of the Arts, SMU Skip to main content SMU Explore SMU Academics Undergraduate Admission Student Affairs About SMU News Athletics Events Calendar George W. Bush Presidential Center Prospective Students Current Students Alumni Information for Faculty & Staff Apply to SMUGIVE NOW Meadows School of the Arts Areas of Study Admissions About Menu Search News News Archive: 2016 5 Tips on How to Double Major 5 Tips on How to Double Major Can you double major and keep everything in balance? Four Meadows students share their advice April 20, 2016 Students thinking about double majoring want to know: Can you really combine a performing, visual, or communication arts degree with a degree in business or engineering, or applied physiology, human rights, computer science or any of the more than 100 majors offered by SMU? Below, four Meadows double majors share their expert advice on how to tackle more than one major and still have time for your friends, meals, sleep and more. JUGGLING STUDIES, SOCIAL LIFE, STUDENT CLUBS, CAUSES – CAN YOU REALLY HAVE IT ALL? Margeaux Scholz, B.F.A. Theatre/Acting, B.A. International Studies; minors in Spanish and in history, ’22 It’s all about learning how to manage your time. I am a multi tasker by nature, but if you don’t want to be doing everything at once I suggest getting things done as early as possible and planning out the rest. Taking breaks and getting enough sleep should be just as much a priority as all of the things on your to-do list – otherwise there is no way you can do it all effectively. Aysia Lane, B.A. Film and Media Arts, B.A. Journalism ’23 I would not be nearly as organized if it weren’t for my agenda and an army of pens and highlighters! I sit down before the semester starts with all of my class syllabi and I write out all assignment due dates and other important dates (family events, birthdays, campus events, etc.) for every month until the end of the semester. I color code my classes and highlight major essays, quizzes and exams. It helps me identify weeks that I will be really busy and plan ahead for how to tackle the upcoming cluster of due dates or events. Wren Lee, B.A. Film and Media Arts, B.A. Creative Computing; minors in human rights and in women and gender studies ’22 tinyurl.com/wrenlee I admit it’s hard to juggle everything sometimes. I’ve had to drop some clubs because of lack of time. I made a chart for the things I’m passionate about, and I try to have an activity in every category every semester. This way I fulfill all my intrinsic needs. While taking 12–15 credit hours, I have two TA jobs, I’m a student assistant in Fondren Library, plus I have activist projects and more. What I do is use multiple calendars, one on my phone, and one in my planner to plan my day by the hour. I also try to coordinate my classes so that some days are clearer than others (usually Mondays or Fridays). It’s really important to keep track of your long-term assignments like final projects and papers. For that, I use the Semester-at-a-Glance calendar [provided by A-LEC, the SMU Altshuler Learning Enhancement Center]. What’s the best way to work with your degree or academic counselors? Aysia I always come to my advising appointments with a list of questions I have about certain classes, professors or advice they may have about how best to approach my next semester. I spend the week before my appointment asking upper-division and professors under my majors about my next steps class-wise and their recommendations for professors. I then configure a “wish list” of classes. I am aware that classes fill up or may turn out to be better for a later time in my academic career and in light of that I have a list of about three or four classes that I could swap out, fill a UC credit with and still enjoy equally! I plan ahead for meetings to leave time for questions and concerns so that I can leave my meeting feeling resolved and optimistic about the upcoming semester. Mindset is everything! Margeaux Part of being an advocate for yourself means building a personal relationship with each advisor that you have. Even though they have your best interests at heart, academic counselors see a ton of people, so make sure you are communicating with them both virtually and face to face. Don’t be afraid to ask questions when you feel lost – it is your right to get as much information as you feel like you need for your education! Wren I see my advisors more as mentors and guides who help me battle my degree progress reports. I love my pre-major advisor Joshua Beaty. He’s an honors advisor and a film kid to boot. Due to our similar interests, we spent most of our sessions talking about random things related to film and media, not just my four-year plan. I recently declared my Meadows majors and now have Janet Stephens as my advisor. She’s very helpful with thinking through my classes and signing off on papers. Check with your advisors and directors of your programs to see if classes can double count for both majors’ requirements. It’s a life saver! Know that some programs are more lenient than others with this type of action. Also, talk with upperclass students in your major. I’ve talked a lot to two film upperclass students who’ve helped me figure out my classes. I am so thankful for their advice and mentorship. OVERLOAD: HOW DO YOU RESTORE A SENSE OF BALANCE? WHAT PRACTICAL STEPS CAN YOU RECOMMEND? Evan Schumacher, B.F.A. Dance Performance, B.A. Philosophy; minor in cognitive science ’22, Website There will come a time where the things that you love become more challenging. A few things to remember are that this does not mean that you don’t love it anymore, or that you are a bad artist/student, or that your professors hate you. What it means is that you have invested so much of yourself that you are starting to feel it. It is important for every student to prepare for this. It is not a bad thing to admit that eventually you might get tired, and the smartest thing to do is to find what you will need before you get to your tipping point. Save some flex (Lifesaver gummies won’t fix everything, but they are a good start), know which professors you feel comfortable around, and share your woes with your friends (both in and out of Meadows). These things will position you so that when it starts to feel overwhelming you will have the support already in place. Extra advice: SMU has a counseling service that is helpful and available. These people have trained a long time to understand how to help you, and sometimes they can provide tools that you might have never thought of! If you love what you do, then make it real. SMU provides the opportunity to stake a position in the world of art and beyond. Take it. - Evan Schumacher PRESSURE AND STRESS – FROM PROFESSORS, PARENTS, PEERS, PAPERS, DEADLINES ... HOW DO YOU KEEP PRESSURE AT BAY? Wren The most pressure comes from me. I know what I can do, and I want to succeed in everything I’m passionate about. But this isn’t possible all the time. I’ve come to accept my limitations as a human and accept failure as a stepping stone in the learning process. Margeaux The best thing you can do for yourself is to trust. Trust that you know yourself best, listen to what you know you need, and know that if all else fails, the world will keep turning. I feel like so much of the time we think that if things don’t go according to plan that there is no alternative and everything will fall apart. In reality, if you are double majoring it already means that you are a curious, innovative and adaptable person and will find a way to keep things moving! Another thing to remember is that most professors are actually really helpful and want you to succeed as long as you are willing to communicate and work with them. SLEEP: HOW CAN YOU GET ENOUGH SLEEP WHEN WORKING ON TWO OR MORE DEGREES AT THE SAME TIME? Evan Sleep can be a challenge when trying to juggle different responsibilities. Sometimes you just won’t get the duration of sleep you might desire because of mandatory rehearsals or group projects. In those times it is important to remember to maintain sleep quality. Try not to spend an hour every night figuring out your schedule in bed. When you study or practice, put all your effort into that, but when you are ready to sleep make sure you put the effort in there, too. Turn off the screens, read a physical book, try to meditate; these things will allow you to maximize the time you spend sleeping so that when you get up you are ready to go again. Margeaux It can be really hard to get the sleep you need, especially during exam times or when you have rehearsals from 6 to 11 every night of the week. Something really essential that I have had to learn that has helped with this, however, is how to say “no.” This doesn’t mean that you can’t hang out with friends or go out at the end of the week, but maybe not every night if you’re swamped. You’re going to have to ask yourself what is more important to you, and it will change on a day-to-day basis. BONUS TIPS, TRICKS, ADVICE, OR OBSERVATIONS Wren Double or triple majoring is definitely possible. Something that makes SMU special is the ease of interdisciplinary studies. People always wonder how I can double major. I can do what I do because of interdisciplinary programs. If you’re thinking about double or even triple majoring, consider how those programs intertwine and interact with each other. You never know what combinations you might find! Aysia I’ve realized that the more time I allow myself to do normal things like working out, grocery shopping, grabbing lunch with friends, etc. and take away some of the monotony of only studying and being a full-time student, the better I apply myself to my studies. Being able to go and do things that have nothing to do with school helps me feel more motivated to do better because it isn’t forced and I’m not feeling overworked, which can lead to resentment and burnout right before exams. Evan The library in Meadows is top tier, and you can reserve rooms in there for anything. Also, don’t forget why you started: You are an incredible artist and sometimes you just need to dance/paint/play in the dark with no one watching. You are the person who defines who you are: There is no need to wait and see if people’s predictions about you become true. If you love what you do, then make it real. SMU provides the opportunity to stake a position in the world of art and beyond. Take It. Margeaux My biggest advice on double majoring and all of your college activities in general is that you should love what you do. I spend most of my time making art in a basement with the same 16 people every day and I wouldn’t have it any other way. If what you’re doing doesn’t make you happy, do something else. I know you’ve heard it before, but life is too short not to do what you love!

FAQs Skip to main content SMU Explore SMU Academics Student Affairs About SMU News Events Calendar Research George W. Bush Presidential Center Current Students Alumni Information for Faculty & Staff Apply to SMUGIVE NOW Undergraduate Admission Apply Visit Financial Aid Menu Search Apply Transfer FAQs FAQs Transfer Benefits of an SMU Education Transfer Scholarships Transfer Admission Application Process Transfer Dates and Deadlines Transfer Pathway Guides Transfer Equivalency Tool Meadows Auditions and Portfolios Transfer Forms and Applications International Transfer Students FAQs Congratulations on your admission to SMU! How Credits Transfer Partnership Programs What are the minimum requirements for transferring to SMU? SMU’s Office of Undergraduate Admission separates transfer students into two categories, transfer and first-year transfer, based on the number of transferrable hours completed at the time of application. For full details on transfer requirements, visit our Transfer Admission page. What is the maximum number of units that can transfer? A minimum of 60 credit hours must be completed at SMU to earn your degree. However, if you have more than 62 transferable hours, they will all “transfer” and be used in the admissions, scholarship and financial aid process. You and your SMU academic advisor will determine which hours will apply to your degree. Which courses transfer to SMU? Each academic department determines which courses will transfer. Based on your credit transfer evaluation and several other factors, the Admission Office determines your admissibility. Generally, if SMU has a comparable course (equal in content and level), you are likely to receive credit for the course. If you attend Dallas County Community College, Tarrant County College, or Collin College, transferability can be easily determined because we have equivalency guides for those colleges. Is transfer credit given for correspondence courses? No. Who determines which courses will transfer? The individual academic departments for each school determine course transferability. Do I need to submit my high school transcript? Yes, we use the high school transcript for several reasons: 1) to verify math readiness (algebra I, geometry, algebra II) when the college transcript does not show college algebra or higher, 2) to determine admissibility of a transfer student who has less than 30 transferable hours and 3) to register and to verify two years of the same foreign language. How is my transferable GPA calculated? Your transferable GPA is determined by including all courses that are considered comparable to SMU courses from every college attended. The number of grade points earned is divided by the number of attempted hours. If you receive a D or F in a comparable course, the D or F will be used in the calculation of your GPA, but you will not actually be awarded transfer credit for that course, since SMU does not award credit for grades lower than C-. If you receive a D or F in a course that is not comparable, then it will not be counted in the GPA. What kinds of scholarship opportunities are available for transfer students? Full tuition opportunities exist for students from Dallas, Collin, Tarrant, Grayson, Kaufman and Navarro County Community College Districts with 50 transferable hours and a 3.70 GPA. Half tuition opportunities also exist for transfer students coming from any college or university with 50 transferable hours and a 3.70 GPA. For more information, visit Transfer Scholarships. First-year transfers with a competitive high school profile and less than 30 transferable hours may be eligible for First-Year Scholarships. On what should I write my essay, and how long should it be? While an essay is not required for transfer admission, it is strongly encouraged. The essay provides a chance to move beyond the numbers and statistics. It's your chance to set yourself apart from all the other applicants. A thoughtful, well-written essay can positively influence the admission committee's final decision and is a critical element in the selection of winners for competitive scholarships. The essay topic and length will be determined by the application method (The Common Application, ApplyTexas, SMU Transfer Application) you choose. All essays will be reviewed equally, regardless of application type. Do foreign transcripts require additional documentation? Yes. Any student who submits a foreign transcript is responsible for submitting the additional documentation required for evaluation. Keep in mind that for SMU to convert the courses to US credits, we need very specific information about the term calendar year, grading scale, course descriptions, length of class, etc. To understand more about the documentation required, see Transfer Credit Policies for International Students. What kinds of resources are available to U.S. Veterans transferring to SMU? Veterans must meet general admission requirements for transfer. For information on benefits and financial assistance, see our Veterans Affairs page. Do I have to reapply if I have previously applied? You do not have to fill out another application, but you do need to complete a Transfer Update Form. How do I seek readmission to the University? If you were previously enrolled at SMU, but have not been enrolled for two or more regular terms (regular terms are fall and spring), or if you have been suspended, then you must be readmitted to SMU. To begin the readmission process, you must complete the Readmission Application (PDF).

Mustang Transfers Tau Sigma National Honors Society Contact Us Contact Us Transfer Student Services Staff ☰ Enrollment Services Transfer Students How Credits Transfer How Credits Transfer SMU offers tools to help you determine how credits will transfer, as well as to assist with course selection at your current institution to meet SMU core and major requirements. The Equivalency Course Tool helps you create a transfer report to see what courses transfer. If SMU has a corresponding course to one you've taken, the SMU course equivalency is listed. Transferable courses for which there is no exact SMU equivalent are awarded elective credit and given an "XX", "YY" or other generic course number. Transfer Pathway Guides for the Common Curriculum and specific majors suggest courses and term plans to keep you on track to meet requirements at SMU. Guides for scholarships, financial aid, international students and veterans are also available. When planning your move to SMU, keep the following transfer policies in mind: Official college transcripts are required for ALL college-level work attempted, regardless of transferability. University policy requires that of the 120 minimum required term hours for a degree, at least 48-60 hours must be earned in residence at SMU. Within this framework, all students must complete SMU's Common Curriculum and at least one major in order to earn an undergraduate degree. If you are currently attending a college or university on the quarter system, your course credits will be converted to semester credits. Quarter hours are converted to semester hours by multiplying by two-thirds (0.67000). If you are unsure what type of credit system your institution follows, refer to the transcript legend on your transcript or your institution's catalog or website. Transfer Credit FAQs Partnership Programs with SMU CC Transfer Students DCCCD Transfer Students McLennan Transfer Students TCCD Transfer Students Transfer Pathway Guides Transfer Pathway Guides are helpful tools which allow you to easily match your transfer coursework with requirements at SMU. These guides provide information on admission procedures and requirements, academic programs, and course conversions. A degree from SMU is typically comprised of a minimum of 120 hours, 60 of which must be completed in residence at SMU. Components of the degree include: Courses in your major Courses required for the Common Curriculum (CC) Elective courses. These electives may also be used to add a second major or minor. Use these comprehensive Transfer Pathway Guides to identify courses which satisfy these three components for a smooth transition to SMU. Informational guides for financial aid, international students, veterans, the University Honors Program and merit scholarships are also available. University Honors Program SMU's University Honors Program (UHP) allows highly engaged and motivated students of all majors to enhance their academic experience at SMU by satisfying the University Curriculum in small, discussion-based honors classes. In addition to these classes, UHP students participate in an honors community that offers a full calendar of optional honors events including lectures, field trips, book discussions, lunches, and dinners. Fellowships are also available for independent research. Students who complete the UHP graduate with honors from the University. In order to participate in SMU's UHP, you must have a transferable GPA of 3.7. A short application process is required. Click here for an information sheet. Contact your admissions counselor for an application. Transfer Planning As a prospective transfer student, you are assigned an admission counselor to help you understand SMU's requirements and procedures, explore academic interests, clarify academic expectations, and prepare you for your transfer to SMU. Long-range planning is the key to success. Our degree programs are designed to give you flexibility, as well as the expertise you need to succeed. Start Planning Now Now is the time to start academic planning by reading through the admission requirements and degree requirements in SMU's Undergraduate Catalog. The University Advising Center website is also a valuable tool for familiarizing yourself with academic policies, and exploring what SMU has to offer. Are you Math Ready? What is math readiness, and why is it important to the transfer admission process? As part of SMU's Common Curriculum, you must complete a math fundamentals requirement consisting of one, three-hour math course. Math readiness is an indication you are prepared to satisfy this requirement, if you are not already transferring in a course to meet it. To be "math ready," you must complete college algebra or a high school sequence of Algebra I, Algebra II and Plane Geometry within the last three years to be considered for transfer admission. These courses should prepare you to take one of the SMU math courses when you arrive. SMU does not accept developmental math courses for transfer. Please pay careful attention when choosing math courses at your current institution. If you are choosing a math course for transfer to meet the University Curriculum math requirements, check your institution's course descriptions against the SMU's Course Descriptions. SMU Admission staff is available to help with any questions you may have. Please contact your Transfer Admission Counselor. Transfer Credit Evaluation Once your transcripts are received at SMU, your coursework will be evaluated, and a Transfer Evaluation Report will be created. You will want to review the Transfer Evaluation Report carefully to confirm that the evaluation is accurate. Standards for Official Transcripts Official college transcripts are required for all college-level work attempted, regardless of transferability. To be considered "official," transcripts must be received at SMU directly from the transferable institution. A transcript issued to you is acceptable by SMU provided it is received in a sealed, letterhead envelope with the Registrar’s Office stamp. SMU only accepts electronic transcripts sent from the transferable institution. We will not accept electronic transcripts sent by students. Transcripts must be dated fewer than three years prior to processing. Coursework from one institution which appears on an official transcript from another institution will not be accepted for transfer credit. An official transcript must be issued by each institution attended. Also, copies of transcripts provided by other institutions are not acceptable. For standards applied to transcripts issued by non-U.S. institutions, see our International Transfer Students page. If you are transferring from a U.S. institution(s), send your transcripts to: Office of Undergraduate Admissions SMU P.O. Box 750181 Dallas, TX 75275-0181 Electronic transcripts from the transferable institution via a secure means (e.g., Scrip-Safe, NSC, GreenLight) should be sent to ugadmission@smu.edu. If you are transferring from a foreign institution(s), have your transcripts and related documents sent to: The International Center SMU 6185 Airline Road, Suite 216 Dallas, TX 75205 USA If you are a current SMU student, have your transcripts sent to: University Registrar SMU P.O. Box 750181 Dallas, TX 75275-0181 Electronic transcripts from the transferable institution via a secure means (e.g., Scrip-Safe, NSC, GreenLight) should be sent to ugadmission@smu.edu. Transfer Evaluation Report What is the Transfer Evaluation Report? The Transfer Evaluation Report (TER) is a comprehensive report of how your college work will transfe­r to SMU. The TER includes the transfer G.P.A. and a detailed list of every course you enrolled in at other universities or colleges. The list shows which courses have been approved for SMU credit, and also the reasons why other courses were deemed non-transferable. How does SMU determine which courses transfer? Official college transcripts are required for all college-level work attempted before you enter SMU, regardless of whether or not those courses are approved for transfer credit. SMU accepts most college-level academic credits earned with grades of “C-“ or better. The courses must be from a regionally accredited institution, acceptable in content, and comply with all other SMU transfer policies. Transferable courses are used to determine your Transferable G.P.A., which is then reviewed by counselors for admission to SMU and for transfer student scholarship consideration. The Transfer G.P.A. is based on all transferable coursework. The last grade prior to matriculation in repeated courses where the original grade was a "F" or "D" is used in the Transferable G.P.A calculation. Coursework attempted in another college's conditional or probationary program is also used. College-level courses taken at another institution, but not offered at SMU, may receive generic course numbers or free-elective transfer credit. These courses must have been completed with a grade of “C-“ or better at regionally accredited colleges or universities that meet SMU standards. Courses in this category include number designations ending in “XX”, “YY”, “U1”, “U2”, etc. Why are courses not approved for transfer credit? If a course is determined to be non-transferable, a code corresponding to the reason for that determination is noted on the right side of the report. Explanations of those codes are listed in the table below. Non-Transferable Code on Code Descriptions Transfer Evaluation Report NTCN Course does not meet SMU standards for content NTPL Course does not satisfy SMU academic policies NTXX Further information is needed to evaluate the course NTVO Course is vocational or technical NTRE Course is below college level or remedial (e.g., Developmental English, math, and reading courses; ESL courses) Course completed with a grade below a "C-", a Withdrawal, or a course in NTGR progress (IP) (Note: Although the course is non-transferable, a grade below C- will be calculated into the all-college G.P.A. and will affect admission eligibility) Transferable GPA All grades for transferable courses are used to calculate the transfer GPA. Courses with a grade of D or F are not transferable to SMU for credit, however the grades are calculated into the transfer GPA. Exceptions are made for repeated courses where the grades in the first attempts were D+ or lower. In these cases, only grades in the last attempts of the repeated courses prior to matriculation at SMU are used to calculate the transfer GPA, even if lower. To qualify for the transfer grade replacement, courses must be repeated at the same institution in which the original grade was earned or carry the same course number based on a statewide course numbering system. For repeated courses where the grade in the first attempt was a C- or higher, all grades will be used to calculate the transfer GPA but credit will be awarded for only the first successful attempt. A grade of W (Withdrawn) is not used to calculate the transferable GPA. A grade of I (Incomplete) or a missing grade is calculated as F. A grade of IP (In Progress) for a current term is not calculated. This grade replacement policy for eligible transfer courses will be used in all transfer and all-college GPA calculations and other academic determinations at SMU. For some majors requiring a subset of courses and specific GPAs for entry, the subset GPA is calculated using the first graded attempt of these courses, even if the first attempt of the course was failed or later repeated. Transfer course grades are not calculated in major/minor GPAs. Generic Department Elective Credit Generic elective credit for transferable courses for which there is no exact SMU equivalent are given an "XX", "YY," “U1,” or “U2” designation. Free Elective Transfer Credit Free elective transfer credit (FETC) is awarded to courses not taught at SMU. FETC may be awarded for appropriate courses completed with a grade of C- or better at regionally accredited colleges or universities that meet SMU's academic standards. Credit for Courses “Passed” SMU accepts the grade of "Pass" for transfer courses as long as the grading scale used at the awarding institution awards a P for courses passed with a C- or better. For example, if the transferring institution defines "P" as passing with a C- or better, then SMU will evaluate the course as a "P" and award credit. SMU students are limited to a total of 12 hours of Pass credits. This includes grades earned for accepted transfer courses. This requirement cannot be waived. Courses that do NOT transfer to SMU Courses below college level (e.g. Developmental English, Math and Reading courses; ESL courses) Vocational - Technical courses including Workforce Education courses PE activity courses in excess of two hours Correspondence courses Courses completed at a school that is not regionally accredited Courses with a grade below a "C-" (Note: Although the course is non-transferable, the grade received below a C- will count towards a student's admission eligibility and is calculated into his/her all-college GPA, which is used when calculating Latin degree honors at graduation time.) Credit by examination earned at another college or university Please note: If a course on your Transfer Evaluation Report receives an evaluation of NTCN and you believe it should transfer, please email transfer@smu.edu for a second review. Academic Forgiveness SMU allows students to dismiss coursework taken 10 or more years prior to the term of admission. These courses are not considered part of your admission review and are not included in the calculation of your transferable GPA or hours earned for transfer to SMU. Applicants must submit official transcripts and SMU's Academic Forgiveness Form along with all other required application materials at the time of admission to receive academic forgiveness.

From the moment I first stepped onto the Boulevard, I knew SMU was the place for me. This place is beautiful, and I love being here when all the students are outside enjoying it. Each undergraduate college has its own personality and vibe. I love walking into Meadows to catch a glimpse of dress rehearsal performances. Dedman College is a classic on campus, but don’t get caught stepping on the seal in Dallas Hall! Rumor has it, you won’t graduate in 4 years. Cox conversations are my favorites to observe. Lyle’s innovation and technology on display inspire me to think about the future; and with education being my favorite subject, it’s hard for me not to find a kindred spirit at Simmons. It’s so much fun being on campus and experiencing it all over again. Favorite place on campus: That’s a tough one, but I’d have to say the Meadows School of the Arts. The college just finished a 2.5 year renovation and the space is spectacular! The talent housed in Meadows is off the charts! I love walking the halls and hearing vocal and instrumental warmups. The art on display is incredible! And the students…I don’t think there are a cooler group of people on campus! Favorite place in Dallas: My family and I love birds and wildlife. The John Bunker Sands Wetland Center is a short drive just outside of the city but the perfect escape from the hustle and bustle. It’s less than 30 minutes from campus. Check it out! Favorite restaurant near campus: I LOVE so many; it’s hard to choose! When in Texas, I believe it’s criminal not to experience Tex Mex. Rusty Taco has the best breakfast tacos in town! What I recommend during your stay in Dallas: Dallas has great shopping, restaurants, and art! I’d say spend the morning at the Nasher Sculpture Gardens, enjoy lunch at the Klyde Warren Park food trucks, and head over to Highland Park Village for some afternoon shopping.

SMU is special, and I hope you visit campus to feel it! I came here from a large public university in Florida, where close community felt unattainable. You’re never a number at SMU, and you aren’t lost in crowds. Professors care about you, including enriching Faculty-in-Residence who live in Residential Commons. I’m the first person in my family to go to college, so I’m especially proud of SMU’s First-Generation Initiative. Favorite place on campus: I love our abundant fountains, plus the tanning pool outside of the Dedman Center for Lifetime Sports—where you’ll find a climbing wall, pool, gyms, indoor track, sports courts and more. But my favorite spot is the Wave sculpture outside the phenomenal Meadows Museum of Art. It’s a moving, undulating, kinetic sculpture above a reflecting pool. An engineering wonder! Favorite place in Dallas: Pelican Point at White Rock Lake! This gorgeous spot is perfect for when you’re homesick for Georgia’s Chattahoochee or Lake Lanier, or if you’re a paddleboarding Floridian like me who loves beautiful sunsets over calm water. Watch the sailboats sharing waves with pelicans, swans, and ducks. Head to the lake to study, run, bike, and find serenity in quiet nature. Favorite restaurant near campus: Desperados is a fantastic Tex-Mex restaurant close to campus. It’s an authentic family-run restaurant rooted in showcasing the culinary diversity of Mexico, while also serving untraditional twists and modern favorites like their famous Desperados Tacos. To satisfy your sweet tooth, stop by Chocolate Secrets—a dessert gem that offers handmade gourmet chocolates and lively open mic nights. What I recommend during your stay in Dallas: Go downtown to see the Giant Eye—the weirdest but coolest eyeball sculpture you’ve ever seen. Keep walking down Elm Street to the Grassy Knoll and Dealey Plaza, the historic site of JFK's assassination. The depth and diversity of Dallas will be on full display! Scan the city skyline and picture your future at SMU—you want to choose a city and university that feels like home. #FirstGen Admission Staff Claire Aherns Dante Branch Sydney Castle Jeremy Brown Anna Lee Buehn Joe Davis Ayah Krisht Joe Francisco Brenda Del Rio Rick Diaz Kim Herman Elena D.

Home-Schooled or Non-Traditional High School Students Skip to main content SMU Explore SMU Academics Student Affairs About SMU News Events Calendar Research George W. Bush Presidential Center Current Students Alumni Information for Faculty & Staff Apply to SMUGIVE NOW Undergraduate Admission Apply Visit Financial Aid Menu Search First Year Additional applicant types Home-Schooled or Non-Traditional High School Students Home-Schooled or Non-Traditional High School Students Additional applicant types Graduate Studies Home-Schooled or Non-Traditional High School Students Readmit (Former SMU Students) Veteran Applicants Visiting Students SMU happily accepts and reviews applications from students attending non-traditional high schools, including homeschools and online high schools. A student who has been home-schooled is subject to the same review as a student applying from a traditional high school (please follow the application instructions). We ask that all home-schooled students complete the Homeschool Supplement. The SMU Admission Committee makes the following additional recommendations for home-schooled students to help them be as competitive as possible in the admission process: Curriculum In our review of applicants, we like to see students challenging themselves academically. Regardless of which curriculum you follow, the committee would like to see, at minimum: Four units of English Three units of mathematics (suggested: Algebra I, Geometry, Algebra II) Three units of science (including two units of laboratory science) Three units of social science Two units of a foreign language (full two-year sequence) Please be aware that students who go above and beyond in the rigor of their academic curriculum generally have an advantage in the admissions process. The average number of core academic courses for an admitted student is 20 units. Official Transcript The admission committee will need something to help us measure your success as a student in your homeschool program. We understand that an official transcript may not be available. If this is the case, please submit a transcript with a consistent grading scheme and/or course descriptions including textbook titles so that we can fully understand your program and what was used to determine proficiency in each academic area. You can use the space provided on the Homeschool Supplement or provide a document in your own format. While not required, it may be beneficial to have your transcript notarized. Recommendation Letters As you will see on our application checklist, a counselor recommendation is required and a teacher recommendation is highly recommended. The counselor recommendation should come from the individual who has coordinated your educational experience and can provide information about the curriculum you used. The teacher recommendation can be completed by a teacher, tutor, or the advisor of an activity in which you participate. If you and your educational coordinator (i.e. “counselor”) feel that your application would be better served through your teacher/tutor recommendation, you are welcome to waive the counselor recommendation by submitting a statement. The wording for this statement can be as follows: I, [Full Name of Educational Coordinator], would like to waive my right to provide a counselor letter of recommendation for [Applicant’s Legal Name] on account that the teacher recommendation letter by [Full Name of Teacher/Tutor] is a better representation of the academic merits of this applicant. Under the terms of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), the applicant has waived his/her right to access the teacher’s recommendation form and letter. We understand that we may not be eligible to review or otherwise inspect the letter of recommendation prior to submission to SMU. Dual-Credit & AP/IB/SAT II Exams Many home-schooled applicants challenge themselves by taking dual-credit courses from local accredited colleges or recommended standardized exams. Because each homeschool experience is different, SAT II subject test and/or AP/IB scores and college-level courses can provide the committee with an additional measure of your ability in core academic subject areas such as English literature, math, and science. We look forward to working with you and reviewing your application for admission. Please feel free to contact Brenda Del Rio with any homeschool-related questions.

It’s important to know the grad school application deadline for your program. Most programs are making funding considerations based on that timeline, and you’ll have the best chance if all of your items are submitted by that date.Some programs operate on a priority deadline and a space available deadline. Others have just one deadline. Be sure that you’ve read the application instructions clearly and that you understand what your program requires. Dedman Deadlines Lyle Deadlines Meadows Deadlines Simmons Deadlines Do I apply to the university and to the program? No, you only have to submit one online application through smu.edu/gradapp. When you start your application, you will select the particular program to which you wish to apply. All of your application materials should be uploaded with your application or submitted to the Graduate Application Processing Office. Can I still apply after the deadline? If the posted deadline has passed but you’re still interested in applying, contact your program’s admissions office to see if there may be space available. Sometimes, programs are still willing to review files from promising applicants. I can’t upload items to my application. How can I apply them to my file? Contact the Graduate Application Processing Office directly by emailing your items to gradappmaterials@smu.edu and they can help you upload them to your file.

Box 518Dallas, TX 75275-0518 When will I receive my decision? Dedman: Most departments will not start reviewing applications until after the posted deadline. If your program holds an interview, then they may not make decisions until after they have invited candidates to come to campus. Generally, most departments try to notify students by early to mid-March, but decisions can be received earlier or later than that.

The general deadline is April 15 for those who receive offers with funding. We ask, however, that you let your program know as soon as possible. Those admitted without funding may be asked to reply by an earlier date, which should be posted in the decision letter.

Applicants for Advertising, Art History, or Music submitting transcripts from foreign universities must also submit a Professional Transcript Evaluation for each with the official transcript. It is the student's responsibility to procure the evaluation(s) and to assume financial responsibility. An exception to this requirement is an exchange agreement between SMU and a foreign institution which is modeled after the U.S. education system.

International applicants who hold a bachelor's degree from a foreign university should not assume that these degrees will be automatically accepted in U.S. universities. Decisions will be based on the academic standings of the institutions from which the applicant has graduated. Professional diplomas and higher certificates from technical or vocational schools are normally not considered as equivalent to a bachelor's degree. Financial Support All international applicants admitted to a graduate program will be notified separately to submit additional documents to request an I-20. A photocopy of passport page which shows official spelling of student’s name will be required as well as proof of financial support, usually in the form of a certified letter from a bank. This should represent that sufficient money will be available to the applicant to cover tuition and fees (any remaining amount that may not be covered by scholarships or assistantships), estimated cost of living in Dallas, and SMU’s health insurance plan. The document must be notarized or certified from the bank and on file before the visas and passports can proceed. For additional information on tuition, fees, and other estimated costs to attend, please see Tuition and Fees. Scholarship Consideration All admitted international students are automatically considered for scholarships and assistantships at the time of admission.

For additional information, please see Scholarships and Financial Aid. Passports and Visas (I-20) Before the international student may depart for SMU, both a passport and a visa are required. The government of the student's home country is responsible for issuing the passport.

The SMU International Advisors' Office will send an I-20 form (F-1 visa or J-1 visa) once the financial support has been verified. It is important that the name on the application matches exactly the name on the student's passport. Course Load Requirement To meet U. S. government regulations, the international graduate student on the F-1 or J-1 visa must must maintain a full course of study for each fall and spring semester as outlined by your program and confirmed by your Academic Advisor/Dean to qualify as a full-time student. For further assistance, you may email smuvias@smu.edu. Health Insurance SMU requires all international students, attending on a visa and taking one (1) or more credit hours, to enroll in the University’s Student Health Insurance Plan. There are two possible exceptions to this requirement: 1) The Embassy purchases and provides the student with comparable US health insurance coverage, 2) A spouse or parent extends U.S. medical insurance benefits through their US employer to the international student, including international medical evacuation and repatriation.

Are there minimum GRE/GMAT test scores or GPA requirements? Not all degree programs in Meadows require the GRE (or the GMAT) and those that do require submission of test scores do not have minimum score requirements. An overall GPA of 3.0 or higher is preferred but consideration will be given to those with a lower GPA upon completion of application and all supporting materials. Consideration into the programs are competitive and while there are no listed minimum scores, those scoring in the 70th percentile and above (155+) with GPAs above 3.0 are given greater consideration for admission and scholarships. The M.A. in Art History and Ph.D. in Art History require the GRE for consideration. The M.A. in Advertising program only requires submission for scholarship and assistantship consideration and also allows the option for submission of the GMAT instead of the GRE. A low GRE or GMAT score or GPA below a 3.0 will not disqualify a candidate from consideration. Is the TOEFL required for all international applicants? Yes.

International applicants to the Performer's Diploma or Artist Diploma program that do not meet the minimum requirements are able to complete a Summer Intensive English Program prior to enrollment should they be admitted. Master’s candidates must meet the minimum score requirements to be eligible for admission. Do I apply to SMU and the Meadows School of the Arts? No. Applicants at the graduate level only submit application to the Meadows School of the Arts, with the exception of Arts Management & Entrepreneurship applicants who should apply directly to the Cox School of Business. All transcripts, test scores and other supplemental application materials should be sent directly to the Graduate Application Processing Office. Apply online for Meadows graduate programs. What should I do first: audition or apply? Supplemental steps in the application such as auditions, interviews, portfolio submission, etc. should be coordinated with your application. Optimal consideration for admission and scholarships is given to candidates who submit a full application and initiate all supplemental requirements before the posted deadline. When will I know about my Meadows admission? Committees meet to evaluate completed applications following the deadline. Some programs will begin sending decisions within 2-3 weeks of a deadline, while others that may have pending audition dates, interviews or call-back dates may have extended release dates. Most programs will have notified their applicants by mid-March with the exception of the final round for Advertising. When will I know about my scholarship package? All candidates who are admitted are automatically considered for scholarships. No additional application or paperwork is required for consideration. Admitted candidates who are given awards will be notified usually within a week following an offer of admission if not sooner. As an international applicant, do I qualify for scholarships and assistantships? Yes. International applicants who are admitted are given the same consideration for awards and assistantships. When should I let the Meadows School know my response to an offer of admission? April 15 is the standard response date, but we encourage candidates to let us know either way as soon as they know. What’s the FAFSA? Your first step in funding college is to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). You cannot apply for, or receive, any financial aid from SMU until we have received either a FAFSA form or, if you don’t feel that you will qualify for need-based aid, a FAFSA waiver. Don't wait to be accepted to complete them - apply early, while you are submitting your applications. The U.S. Department of Education runs a variety of student financial assistance programs, which include grants and loans. Your eligibility for aid is determined by the information that you provide in the FAFSA. SMU will also use your FAFSA to determine your eligibility for scholarships, grants, and institutional aid. These forms are not required of international applicants. Learn more about the FAFSA and apply. The SMU code is 003613. FAFSA must be filed each year for continued consideration of SMU, federal, and state funding.

Discovering a passion to help students, she decided early on that she preferred giving away money rather than collecting it. After transitioning to the main financial aid office as a financial aid counselor, Henderson performed a variety of duties and established a comprehensive knowledge of federal, state and institutional financial aid policies during her 12 years at Texas State. Henderson grew up a few blocks away from SMU as an avid Mustang football fan, so it felt like homecoming when she began her career on the Hilltop in the central financial aid office after moving back to Dallas in 1997. In November 2000, she joined the Meadows School of the Arts as director of scholarships and financial aid. The opportunity to work at Meadows fueled her desire even more to be an advocate for her students and help them navigate the complexities of financing their education and make their dream of an SMU education possible. As director of scholarships and financial aid, Henderson manages a multi-million dollar annual scholarship budget, oversees hundreds of student employees and works closely with the Meadows development office to steward over one hundred student scholarship endowments. In 2008, Henderson was instrumental in the creation of the Meadows Scholar program. This initiative has established numerous endowed scholarships and continues to help attract outstanding students who exhibit the artistic and academic qualities sought by SMU Meadows School. Henderson’s approach to her role is inspired by her parents, who instilled in her a strong work ethic and always told her to accentuate the positive and eliminate the negative. She continues to live by this philosophy every day. Book an appointment Meadows School of the Arts Meadows School of the Arts 6101 Bishop Dallas TX 75205 214-768-2000 Mailing Address: P.O.

Bush Presidential Center Prospective Students Current Students Alumni Information for Faculty & Staff Apply to SMUGIVE NOW Meadows School of the Arts Areas of Study Admissions About Menu Search Meadows Community Meadows is a place where identity is celebrated. We are bettered by the unique perspective and background of each student, staff member, and faculty member. Our community is comprised of people from different countries, races, ethnicities, religions, gender identities, sexual orientations, socio-economic backgrounds, and so much more. Many of our students experience the intersection of multiple identities and marginalized backgrounds. Though Meadows is not a perfect place, there is a commitment to listening, learning, and taking action to be a better environment for students to grow, learn, and create. Meadows Community Meadows Admission Ambassadors Meadows Ambassadors for Prospective Students Resources for Meadows Students Community at Meadows "I appreciate the freedom the most. [Meadows] seems to trust all the students, both undergrad and grad, to be friendly, to be accommodating, to be professional. There are a lot of professional young students in Meadows. I don't care if they're undergrads or grads. They address every situation as a pro. The professors will take care of you. They will foster your growth. They will make sure you have a safe environment to be as creative as you can be." -Natalie / Graduate Student / Theatre Design MFA "Everyone is open minded and welcoming. We respect identity.” - Vinn / Sophomore / Film Major "You don't need to be ashamed of who you are when you're at Meadows" - Benjamin / Sophomore / Music Major "I take the FACE class (First Year Community Experience) in Meadows. That was really fun in terms of meeting other people. I forgot how fun it was to collaborate and see what other people can do and have a discussion going, especially about working in production." -Vinn / Sophomore / Film Major BIPOC I initially thought SMU was primarily a white campus, but fairly progressive. Since coming here, I’ve realized that Meadows is its own beautiful bubble on campus, full of diverse yet like-minded artists. You learn from incredible professors who make your experience so memorable. My opinions changed because I never imagined finding such a community of friends in Meadows and getting to work with people from all over the world. Everyone is accepted and respected. -Shara / Junior / Music Major I would tell a BIPOC student that Meadows, and SMU, can seem intimidating because of how white it is, but don't be too dismayed because there is a [BIPOC] community. We aren’t many, but we are strong, and we support each other in everything. We've got each other’s backs and expect the school to support us too. -Kayla / Sophomore / Theater Major Find a BIPOC professor and fellow students you can trust. Don’t be afraid to try new things. It’s okay to be afraid sometimes, but never feel like you don’t belong, because you do! -Vanessa / Senior / Corporate Communication and Public Affairs Major LBGTQIA+ "Meadows is a wonderful place to be Queer, which drives some very unique and phenomenal art! Meadows wants you to be who you are because who you are is going to inspire the most creative and the best art." -Caroline / Senior / Music Major “One of the most impactful experiences at the Dr. Bob Smith Health Center was when a counselor helped me define my issues. They're very open to issues with sexuality or discovering gender, etc. There are resources and people there who can help.” -Larsen / First-Year / Theatre Student "I feel welcome in the Meadows building. There is no hesitation from professors or students addressing me as I identify. They're working constantly to update themselves to make sure they're woke and relevant in today's world." -Natalie / Graduate Student/ Theatre Design MFA First-Generation “As a first-generation student in college, there are a lot of challenges, obstacles, and pressures. It can be stressful and overwhelming at times. One may not have had the network, money for tutoring, or knowledge about resources. However, thanks to organizations such as the First-Gen Association, the Rotunda Scholars Program, and student clubs, I have been able to surpass most of the difficulties that come along with being a first-generation student. Through these organizations, I have been provided with a support system that includes a list of academic and financial support, professional networking, peer support, resources, tutoring, and more. Navigating college as a first-gen student at SMU has been an experience I am grateful for because I have not felt completely alone in dealing with difficult situations.” -Alexa / Junior / Dance Major “I don't think I could've made it this far without the Rotunda Scholar Program. Whenever I don't know what to do or where to go, I know who I can turn to. Even if they don't have the answer, they know someone who does. They've given me access to the "college experience" that I never thought I could have as a low-income student of color at a predominantly white affluent university.” -Monica / Junior / Theatre Major Meadows School of the Arts Meadows School of the Arts 6101 Bishop Dallas TX 75205 214-768-2000 Mailing Address: P.O.

Hear from students and alumni about the many ways these experiences help prepare them for their careers. Advertising Olivia Ramirez BA in Advertising/Digital Media Strategy; BA in Art ’22 I had the opportunity to work as a media intern for Heineken USA the summer before my senior year. I learned so much through this position attending meetings with people from Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and their ad agency CANVAS. Along with attending meetings throughout the day, I was tasked with creating a presentation where I provided recommendations on how Heineken can better connect with Gen Z. A lot of my input was about how they can better their social media accounts. It went so well that I ended up presenting it three different times to different teams when I was only supposed to present it once! Overall, I gained great experience and industry contacts while working on the brand side of advertising, and further developed my teamwork, research, and presentation skills. Madison Castellano B.A. Advertising/Creative; minor in graphic design ’19 During my internship at Citrus Advertising, I worked with the Alpha Project, a personal training gym known for its intense and effective workout programs and strong, close-knit community. I helped develop a 360 marketing campaign. Working with the owners of the gym, we created the brand’s new logo, produced out-of-home and in-store signage, designed t-shirts and other apparel and accessories, then developed an in-depth marketing plan that broke down budget, business objectives and goals within a detailed calendar for the next few years. This project allowed me to fully immerse myself into a brand and work directly with the client to help bring their business forward. This is why I love advertising; it’s wonderful to help a client with such a compelling story, who is passionate about their dream, find their own voice and find ways to tell that story to people who want to listen and contribute to that growing dream. Next year I will be working at TracyLocke as a junior copywriter for Samsung. Hannah Tymochko B.A. Advertising/Digital Media Strategy; minor in psychology '19 Working as a brand media intern at The Richards Group gave me the real-life experience most students look for. I worked on projects for various clients that sharpened my planning, reporting and analytical thinking skills. I did a variety of projects for multiple clients at various points of the planning stage. This enabled me to see all the elements that go into media planning. Throughout my internship, I got more involved in the programmatic specialty. I learned about programmatic in many of my digital media strategy classes, and working with the team allowed me to see what type of work it actually entails. I produced client-facing documents and was given the opportunity to own projects that made me a key member of the team. My experience at The Richards Group gave me insight into agency life and overall was extremely positive and valuable. Anna Grace Godoy B.A. Advertising/Creative, minor in sociology ’19 During the spring semester of my senior year, I interned at 3HeadedMonster in Dallas. It was amazing because I got to have a hand on so many different projects because it was a small agency. I worked on campaigns for Nothing Bundt Cakes, Wingstop, products and companies that haven't been released yet, and different personal branding projects. I even got to do some branding for the agency itself. I loved my internship at 3HM because it allowed me to see so many different sides of agency life and meet some solid people. It taught me a lot about life in the work force and skills that would help me in any field I go into. Hannah Belsinger (B.A. Advertising, minor in law and legal reasoning ’19) As a brand media intern at The Richards Group in summer 2018, I was able to explore the many specialties within media planning including search engine optimization, digital strategy, media buying and social media across multiple accounts. Having such hands-on and diverse experience working with various teams allowed me to grow not only as a media planner but also as a professional and team player. I also worked with other interns on a group presentation, having to refine my collaboration, research and communication skills every day. Nothing will get you more prepared for the industry than having to give a 25-minute presentation in front of the entire department, which consisted of 100+ directors, planners, buyers and strategists. Getting such exposure to the unique culture of an ad agency allowed me to better understand how every discipline works together to successfully tackle every client’s needs. The Richards Group is a great place for anyone looking to speak up and have their ideas valued and put to great use. Amy Cooley B.A. Advertising/Strategic Brand Management; B.A. in Spanish ’18 “I spent fall semester 2017 interning for the nationally syndicated radio show ‘The Kidd Kraddick Morning Show.”’ While I got to play around on their various social platforms, my main task was running the show’s Twitter feed. It’s kind of crazy, honestly, to think that I was putting out content to over 95,000 followers every day. I also had the opportunity to record my own podcast, ‘21 & Up,’ with my co-intern. We started an Instagram account and figured out the right combination of buttons to hit in a recording studio to make magic happen. Working there was a great experience, getting to see the ins and outs of what it takes to run a radio show, how advertising and marketing works from the media side, and getting to meet some very cool people along the way – celebrities and the fun people who work there. Most importantly, however, I learned to never take for granted getting to sleep past 5:00 a.m. every morning.” [Amy is now a project manager for Dieste, Dallas/New York.] Alex Gurasich B.A. Advertising/Creative and B.A. Film & Media Arts ’18 “My internship experience at GSD&M in Austin was great. I worked in the digital production department and collaborated on projects for Popeyes and the United States Air Force. Some of those projects included testing and distributing recruitment tools for the Air Force and brainstorming on future interactive campaigns for Popeyes. GSD&M also hosted workshops for interns to meet with members from each team at the agency, along with meeting the founders and CEO of the company. Being able to make these kinds of connections and learn about the various teams that work at an agency was incredible and exactly what I was looking for in an internship. All of my coworkers have been friendly and helpful and I could not have asked for a better place to be. I’m honored to have been part of the AAF Vance and Betty Lee Stickell internship.” Marissa Lopez B.A. Advertising 2016 “My internship with Southwest Airlines was extremely rewarding and allowed me to be extremely hands-on and involved in the brand beginning to end. I created digital content for Southwest.com and the Southwest mobile application. One of the biggest takeaways from this experience was the importance of company culture. Southwest embodies everything one would look for when it comes to a wonderful work environment. I got to work with friendly, hard-working individuals whose drive and creativity inspired me. My boss and supervisors understood the importance of work-life balance and really worked with me whenever I felt overwhelmed. My internship with Southwest was truly beneficial for my growth as a designer and young professional. My Meadows professors gave me the tools and knowledge to walk into this internship with confidence and an excellent design and advertising skill set. Southwest gave me the real-world experience that prepared me to succeed in my post-graduation career now.“ [Marissa now works as a junior designer at BBDO New York.] Samantha Butz B.A. Advertising/Creative; B.A. Fashion Media '17 "I was able to travel to the Dominican Republic through SMU's Engaged Learning program. There, I got to experience the culture while visiting a living-wage garment factory and staying in the homes of the workers. I took everything I learned and have created an initiative on campus to promote ethical apparel. The underlying goal is to let students know that sweatshops are unnecessary but also, and more importantly, that we can make a difference in people's lives by the way we choose to purchase items in our everyday life. I want students to know that we are the difference and we have the power to prove that ethical apparel is possible. With the help of my professors and experience through advertising classes, I've been able to create a conversation on campus around the origin of our shirts. It's been an exciting and challenging experience and I'm excited to see how it impacts SMU in the future! In addition, in summer 2016 I had the opportunity to serve as creative intern with Weller Media Agency in New York City, which was an amazing experience. And I'm excited to be interning with Dallas-based Canonball Agency for the fall of my senior year.” (Photo: Samantha with Alta Gracia garment factory worker Alfredo Toledo.) [Samantha is now art director for Citrus Advertising, Dallas.] Tien Dang B.A. Advertising/Creative ’16 "I was a creative copy intern at Publicis HCG in New York City in summer 2015. The coolest part of my internship was being put on a pitch where I worked directly with the associate creative director. My input and ideas were valued and some of my concepts were utilized. I was also a part of a larger internship program called MAIP, which provided me with a lot of awesome opportunities and connections as well. Interning in New York has been a great experience." [Tien now works as the diversity and inclusion coordinator for 4A’s in New York.] Sue Hyun Han B.A. Advertising/Creative ’16 "I loved my first agency experience! I did my internship through MAIP (Multicultural Advertising Intern Program), which placed me in McCann Detroit. The people at McCann Detroit were so kind and accommodating. When I realized that I didn't want to do account management they let me help out in creative. I got to see how everyone in the agency worked together. I became close friends with the fellow interns; we brainstormed together, ate lunch together and came up with our first ads together. Through MAIP, I was also able to go to New York City where we found out that our group won the 2015 MAIP Summer Project for Nike and Wieden+Kennedy." Art Gabi Graceffo B.F.A. Art and B.A. English/Creative Writing Specialization ’20 “While studying abroad in Siena, Italy, for a semester, I was able to work at a graphic design studio, Mc Brain’s, as a graphic designer, photographer and translator. This internship built on my experience with magazine work as the editor-in-chief of Kairos, SMU’s premier undergraduate literary and creative magazine, combining my artistic studies with my writing. I became a translator for the studio and was able to bridge them with English and American companies they had previously had limited access to. The internship skyrocketed my graphic design and linguistic skills and I was offered a job and visa sponsorship at the end of the semester, something I’m considering taking them up on before grad school. I was able to pursue this experience because of Meadows scholarships and have come back ready to dive into my senior year, now with more experience to look toward future work with creative magazine work as both a writer and artist.” Jennifer Wester M.F.A. Art ’21 "Through a project grant and residency with the City of Dallas, provided through the Dallas Office of Arts and Culture, I've had the extensively rewarding opportunity to design and distribute culturally specific paper modeling activities and workshops that hone fine motor skills and spatial reasoning while providing creative inspiration to underserved communities in the area. This work has furthered my paper-works practice, led me to develop important grant writing and project scheduling skills critical to a sustainable arts career and led to the creation of many positive relationships with other local organizations and city entities such as the Dallas Public Library, Love For Kids, Deep Vellum Publishing and Dallas Park & Recreation facilities. The ability to work in collaboration with and have so much agency in a city as large and diverse as Dallas has been invaluable in the development of my goals and vision as an artist. I don't believe there is any other city in the country with as much opportunity for artists to have voice and impact as in Dallas right now." Julia Jalowiec B.F.A. Art ’18 “I came to Meadows as a transfer student and right away dove into the resources and opportunities SMU had to offer. In addition to classes and a trip to study in France, I did an internship with sculptor Deborah Ballard; conducted funded research as an Engaged Learning Fellow on Art Fellowship in Paris, which resulted in a solo sculpture show in downtown Dallas; held a resident artist internship at the Dallas Farmers Market (DFM), for which I organized a collaborative, 150-foot public art wall mural. After the DFM internship, I started work on another public art wall mural and curated a large-scale steel sculpture show featuring the work of artist Dewane Hughes. My opportunities helped me grow not only as an artist, they also helped me grow my network in the art community.” [Photo Southern Methodist University, Hillsman S. Jackson.] Nida Bangash M.F.A. Art ’19 "I'm thrilled to be invited to participate in an exhibition celebrating The Crow Collection of Asian Art Museum's 20th Anniversary this year, where I have been paired with one of the objects I selected from the collection. An answer I give to a set of questions asked in an interview will be chosen as part of the object's in-gallery label. In addition to a solo exhibition at The Reading Room in Dallas in November, I am also working towards a group exhibition titled "I Contain Multitudes" at Milwaukee Institute of Art and Design in January. Here at SMU, I am fortunate to be given an opportunity to be amid a group of wonderful creatives the DFW area has to offer." Andy Davis M.F.A. Art ’16 “One of the features that attracted me to SMU for my M.F.A. in Studio Art was the potential for collaboration with other disciplines. Housed within the Owen Arts Building are the divisions of music, visual art, theatre and dance, to name a few. With the atmosphere of the various arts coexisting in the same space, I saw an opportunity to blur the boundaries between these so-called “divisions.” In my final semester, I approached students from the music and dance divisions to collaborate in producing a chamber operetta for the 2016 M.F.A. Thesis Show, “Above and Below the Surface.” The openness and rigorous abilities of the performers helped bring the work from a fragmented set of impressions to a fully realized project. Interdisciplinary experimentation, navigating unknown territories, challenging categories - these acts constitute a vibrant arts ecosystem and I am grateful to my collaborators and the faculty at Meadows for facilitating this exchange.” [See “Watergrass” video on: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSh9DzH3VpI ] D S Chapman B.F.A. Studio Art ’17 The only thing greater than the Meadows School itself are the outstanding professors who dedicate their time and effort to making students like myself successful in our chosen field. Since my junior year, I have been an exhibitions & programs intern at The Power Station, a not-for-profit contemporary art exhibition space, after Chair of the Division of Art Dr. Noah Simblist connected me with The Power Station Gallery Manager Gregory Ruppe. I have helped with the installation of two exhibitions, one of which was for the international Dallas Art Fair, and I assist with the day-to-day running of The Power Station. The Power Station permitted me to organize a screening of video work from SMU students and alums, and I have been invited to curate the work for one night of their “Sunscreen” summer film series. In addition to continuing my internship at The Power Station during my senior year, I will be working as the studio assistant to artist Jeff Zilm (M.F.A. ’11), a former SMU alumnus. [DS was accepted to three grad schools and will attend University of California San Diego beginning fall 2017.] Diana Antohe B.F.A. Art ’14 My time at Meadows was instrumental in setting the foundation for my career, and continues on with having an incredible and supportive community in the Dallas arts. The summer after graduation I got a studio in the Deep Ellum district in Dallas, where I currently hold my professional studio practice. My studio space has led to several past and upcoming exhibitions. I'll be showing works at a downtown gallery in the spring; I recently had a show with another painter at North Lake College; was selected as a "Rising Star" for the Turner House exhibition at the Oak Cliff Society of Fine Arts; and will be in a women printmaking show at the Bath House Cultural Center in the spring. I am also a studio assistant to another Meadows alumnus, Matthew Cusick (M.F.A. ’13), whom I met during my studies. [Note: In 2016, Diana had residencies at the London Summer Intensive Residency and at the Can Serrat International Center in El Bruc, Spain. Upcoming residencies include the Vermont Studio Center in spring 2017.] Nicolas Gonzalez B.F.A. Art, B.A. Art History ’17 Over the summer I was granted an opportunity to be a part of Pike Park’s first-ever summer camp, where I worked with children ages 5 through 12. Together we were able to construct a huge mural titled “My Pike Park” to bring awareness to the diminishing history of Pike Park and of Little Mexico here in Dallas. This project directed the use of my artistic abilities using a different approach known as social practice. It has opened new possibilities for me, such as a new body of work and recognition throughout the art community. I’ve always believed that art can change the world in some way. (Photo by Parker Smitherman [B.F.A. Film & Media Arts ’15]) Art History Claudia Zapata Ph.D. candidate in Art History ’19 “In the summer of 2017, I was selected as a Marsh Foundation Curatorial Intern by the Georgia O’Keeffe Museum. As an intern I developed several feasibility reports related to prospective virtual reality applications and programming. The museum’s unique organization as a single-artist museum with historical properties in a remote area provided a unique challenge for integrating technological innovation as a form of preservation. The internship allowed me to extend my professional curatorial experience to a world-renowned museum that incorporates its natural landscape as part of the visitor experience. Each museum has a specific set of opportunities it provides for its visitors, and as an intern, I was able to gain more valuable insight into the considerations of the single-artist museum. The administrative and programmatic diversity training that I receive from such experiences is an invaluable professional asset that will incentivize any future employer regarding my abilities to adapt to an arts institution’s professional objectives.” Lauren Richman M.A. Art History ’13; Ph.D. candidate in Art History ’19 "Fellowships complement the pursuit of a Ph.D. in art history by expanding students’ resources and enriching their professional network. For the 2017-18 academic year, I was awarded the Terra Foundation for American Art Predoctoral Fellowship at the Smithsonian American Art Museum (SAAM), which honors projects focused on cross-cultural exchange. While at SAAM, I have been able to access archival materials for dissertation research/writing which concluded in a public lecture, work one-on-one with curators, and meet scholars across disciplines thanks to Washington, D.C.’s rich museum community. Not only has my time at SAAM been instrumental for the completion of my Meadows degree, but also it has provided me with valuable exposure to curatorial work. With the support of the faculty in the Art History Department, I have been able to tailor my education and external opportunities to suit my career ambitions." Lauren King B.A. Art History ’18 “As a student interested in both art history and archaeology, interning with the Perot Museum of Nature and Science was a fulfilling experience. It allowed me to pursue both of my interests in the workplace, understand how research is done in a museum setting and meet people with similar backgrounds further along in their careers. I left the internship with much more knowledge on the workings of a museum, and on what steps I can take to better my chances for success in the future. This internship was a valuable opportunity to match my education with correlating work experience and to gain a better understanding in what kind of projects I enjoy doing outside the classroom.” Rachel Spradley M.A. Art History ’15 As a graduate student hoping to pursue a career in museums, I knew internships would be an important part of achieving my goals. With support from the Meadows Art History faculty, I gained museum work experience both during and after my graduate work. An internship at the Metropolitan Museum in New York offered an opportunity to learn about the variety of roles available throughout a large museum. Now, as a 2015-16 graduate intern at the J. Paul Getty Museum, I am gaining valuable firsthand experience in the Exhibitions department, which manages the logistics surrounding special exhibitions, coordinating the efforts of departments across the museum. The experience is a valuable complement to my Meadows education and one that will further my career goals. [Rachel now works as an exhibitions assistant at the Dallas Museum of Art.] Estelle Hernandez B.A. Art History ’16 It was the best feeling when my education and work experience first began to overlap. Internships with the Dallas Contemporary and other Dallas galleries have given me the opportunity to broaden my knowledge in this field, meet people I admire and have exciting experiences like working in the Dallas Art Fair. Perhaps most important, they have given me the chance to explore my interests and hone my skills. I am currently working in a part-time position with the Dallas Museum of Art, where I have the privilege of doing research work with the Keir Collection. I owe this experience to the foundation I gained from my art history courses and the support of my professors. Lauren Janicki B.A. Art History ’16 With the Jordan Internship at the Meadows Museum I hope to gain a better understanding of the people who are responsible for the everyday and special operations of a museum. I will use my time here at Meadows to help get a better sense of what career I will pursue in the art and museum world and to decide what steps I need to take after I graduate from SMU. I also hope to make lasting connections with the people here who might be able to help and guide me in the next stages of my life. Arts Management & Arts Entrepreneurship Molly McNulty B.A. in Public Relations and Strategic Communication; minor in Arts Management ’20 I had the internship of a lifetime at House of Blues as the marketing and talent buyer intern. As their intern, my favorite task was capturing content from various concerts each month and posting it to the House of Blues Instagram story. Some concerts I covered included Jeremy Zucker and Mike Shinoda. As the intern for the talent buyer, I assisted in creating artist deals for both the Cambridge Room and Music Hall. We conducted research about how a particular artist’s previous shows in Dallas or other similar venues did and created an offer using that information. Artist deals that I assisted in included Still Woozy and Rooney. My course work at SMU helped me in my internship, specifically the Cultural Policy course with Dr. Kathleen Gallagher. Throughout my semester-long project, I learned about the Music Modernization Act, which made me even more excited for a career in the music industry. Valerie Pizzato M.A./M.B.A. Candidate and Forté Fellow ’20 I interned at the Dallas Theater Center in their development department. Coming from a nonprofit theater in New York City, it was enlightening to see the difference in the arts fundraising environment in these two cities. I gained experience with many aspects of fundraising, from individual giving to events, which builds upon SMU’s fall Fundraising in the Arts course. My direct supervisor was an alumna of the M.A./M.B.A. program, Robin Rose ’10, and I had a tremendous time learning from her. While working on individual giving goals, I mastered the art of donor research. I also learned how to use Tessitura, which is central to patron management at many arts organizations. I am well prepared to hold conversations with leaders across the organization about their strategies. My time at the Dallas Theater Center gave me experience at a premiere regional theater (2017 Tony winner, Best Regional Theater) while applying classroom knowledge to real world situations. Paige Harrington M.A./M.B.A. Candidate and Forte Fellow ’19 "My internship with Deep Vellum Publishing initiated me into the Dallas fundraising climate. Because it is such a young organization, I was able to work side by side with the executive director and production editor to build Deep Vellum’s contributed income portfolio and address the organization’s financial needs. I attended grant writing seminars hosted by prominent Dallas nonprofit organizations and wrote 10 grants for four different upcoming projects and programs. The fundraising courses with Julia Diaz provided all the knowledge and practice that I needed to be successful in development. Each of the M.A professors share current, first-hand experience, providing a unique awareness of nonprofit function, which was integral to my success during my internship. I walked into Deep Vellum with not only a passion for books but all the essential knowledge to help the organization continue to grow. I gained a new understanding of running a business with a dynamic environment, which has prepared me to launch my own nonprofit publishing house." Julia Farina M.A./M.B.A. Candidate and Forte Fellow ’19 “As the development intern at Theatre Communications Group (TCG) I was able to work with both their Individual Giving & Specials Events and Institutional Advancement & Partnerships departments. This dual position allowed me to experience and work on projects that touched many aspects of fundraising. Summer is a busy time at TCG - they host their annual national conference in June, the end of their fiscal year occurs in July, gala planning is underway and many foundation reports and government grant applications are due. While working on these things and more, I was able to work on hard skills, such as mastering Raiser’s Edge and writing grant proposals, and soft skills, such as communicating with current and prospective donors and managing cross-functional teams. TCG is truly at the center of the nonprofit theater world, and it was a fantastic experience being able to witness and learn about all the amazing work happening in the field nationwide.” Angie Reisch B.F.A. Art, minor in arts entrepreneurship ’18; SMU President’s Scholar, Meadows Scholar "While I was interning at the North Texas Business Council for the Arts (BCA) in Dallas, I worked on a research project looking at which businesses in North Texas were supporting arts and cultural organizations. It was the first time I had worked on such a long-term and exhaustive research project and worked with a professional economist to analyze my work. The results of the research will be published in a white paper in fall 2018. My internship was incredibly valuable to me because I got to see firsthand how an arts nonprofit operates and runs on a day-to-day basis, which was something I had learned a lot about in my AMAE classes. I am very excited to be working with BCA full time now as their programs manager." [Photo: Reisch, lower left, with BCA staff members and volunteers at the 2017 BCA Obelisk Awards.] Andrew Reynolds M.A./M.B.A. ’18 During my internship at Interlochen Center for the Arts, I was an events manager and administrative assistant for Trey Devey, Interlochen’s newly appointed president. The opportunity to witness and collaborate on the transition of power, multiple methods of executive time management, board relations, external relations, restructuring and the confidential and critical issues that run through the president’s office has been invaluable to crafting my own executive strategy. The M.A./M.B.A. allowed me to have substantive conversations with senior management. The M.A. portion of the degree has prepared me with the most up-to-date and researched practices in arts and culture management, development, nonprofit finance and governance. The M.B.A. has prepared me for operational success, financial awareness, conversations with a board primarily made up of for-profit business minds and deriving strategy based on the current economic environment. Without both parts of the degree, successfully managing all relevant stakeholders of an arts and culture organization would prove much more challenging. Mariama Holman M.A./M.B.A. ’18 My internship experience at Americans for the Arts in New York City helped me understand the broader role the arts play in creating an economic impact within their communities. By working on projects relating to the Arts & Economic Prosperity 5 Study and the Business Contributions to the Arts: 2017 research, I learned how local arts agencies can meet head-to-head with other industries within their community to advocate for partnerships and initiatives that support the development of the arts economy. My graduate coursework in marketing with Zannie Voss and Jill Robinson was instrumental in understanding not only the complex ecosystem of arts community stakeholders, but also learning how to cultivate unilateral interest in Americans for the Arts content among businesses, chambers of commerce and local arts agencies. Chelsea Marshall M.A./M.B.A. ’18 “The lessons and case studies from Meadows were an integral part of my day at the Solomon R. Guggenheim, where I interned in the marketing department. Courses like ‘Nonprofit Marketing Strategy’ and ‘Audience Development & Marketing in the Arts’ provided me with the confidence to jump right into projects and the practical experience to collaborate on teams. Through digital strategy and brand positioning initiatives, I helped promote public awareness and monitor visitor experiences at the museum. The Guggenheim also encouraged interns to gain a broad understanding of museum operations and the cultural community through its Museum Culture Seminar Program. These discussions with gallery owners, curators, artists, and designers offered a unique insight into the art mecca of New York City as well as the broader role of museums in our world.” Phuong Vu M.A./M.B.A. ’17 “It was an exciting time to intern at the Georgia O’Keeffe Museum communications department with their recent re-branding effort and big international travelling exhibitions, all during the busiest travel season in Santa Fe. I benefited greatly from the Web & Social Media Analytics course at SMU Cox School of Business, where I learned more about cutting-edge tools and refined digital media strategy. My Meadows courses all set the firm foundation for my understanding of nonprofit organizations, challenged my marketing views, allowed me to see the big picture and helped improve my collaboration skills with other departments. The impact of data-driven decisions in art administration has opened my perspective to a new career track.” Veronica Treviño M.A./M.B.A. ’17 “Having the good fortune to intern in the multifaceted exhibitions department of the Dallas Museum of Art, I enjoyed a very dynamic experience, with exposure to an assortment of tasks and responsibilities. Comprised of a multitude of departments, the museum’s welcoming staff made scheduled and impromptu informational interviews possible. Possessing a cursory knowledge of the diverse sets of priorities and obligations held by the various constituents involved in a nonprofit organization was a framework afforded by my course work. This context propelled my conversations at the museum into fruitful and potent exchanges of knowledge that I will take with me throughout my career.” [Photo: Veronica at the Dallas Museum of Art.] Caroline Webb M.A./M.B.A. ’17 “My experience as the annual fund and donor benefits intern at The Santa Fe Opera contributed greatly to my comprehensive understanding of the fundraising process. Lessons learned in SMU’s M.A./M.B.A program - especially in Fundraising in the Arts and Advanced Fundraising Strategy with JoLynne Jensen - were critical to successfully meeting the challenges of my hands-on involvement in the fundraising and special events activities of this world-class development department. Applying lessons learned at SMU to such real world situations allowed me to grow as an arts administration professional and gave me a clearer vision of possibilities going forward.” Kristen Lega M.A./M.B.A. ’16 During my time as an intern with the Dallas Symphony Orchestra, I was able to be thoroughly immersed in the arts administration atmosphere. Having the opportunity to work with a variety of departments there gave me an overarching view of the industry, as well as some hands-on involvement, and I found it to be extremely valuable. Getting that insight into the inner workings of an organization such as this provided me with a tremendous amount of new knowledge that seamlessly complements the education I am receiving through SMU’s M.A./M.B.A. program. [Kristen now works as a search coordinator for Resolution Media in Chicago, working on campaign plans, strategies and optimizations, data analysis, industry changes and more.] Emily VanderWall M.A./M.B.A. ’16 I had the opportunity to intern at the Dallas Museum of Art in the marketing department. I was given an audience overview project which allowed me to combine the concepts I was learning in class to real life situations. For instance, creating a museum budget for our finance class helped me understand potential revenue streams while our marketing class gave me ideas for direct marketing tactics and ways to utilize available data. My internship project allowed me to better understand museum audiences and exposed me to the types of strategies and goals a museum might implement from a marketing perspective. [After her subsequent internship at Christie’s, Emily now works as a category marketing specialist for Heritage Auctions.] Corporate Communication and Public Affairs Lauren Lehner B.A. Corporate Communication and Public Affairs; B.A. Public Policy ’21 "During my time as a policy intern at Cornerstone Government Affairs, I had the tremendous opportunity to gain an in-depth understanding of the field of government relations and how private industry influences policy. Additionally, working with a myriad of clients allowed me to not only deepen my understanding of certain policy areas, but also learn and expand those interests to encompass other areas. Over the course of my internship, I was also able to see firsthand how important clear and thoughtful communication is in ensuring the best materials are given to more senior individuals within the firm and ultimately to our clients.&nbsp; My assignments included viewing and summarizing congressional hearings, by drafting analysis memos, identifying and reporting on the current news and legislation trends, and preparing materials for clients testifying before Congress.&nbsp; All of these experiences collectively sharpened my critical thinking and writing skills. As I look toward starting law school, I believe the skills and tools I gained from this internship will prove quite valuable and will help me succeed in the future." Melanie Ekizian B.A. Public Relations and Strategic Communications; B.A. Environmental Studies; minor in Environmental Anthropology ’20 My experience as the global communications intern at Salesforce in San Francisco gave me a true look into the world of public relations in the tech industry. During my 12-week internship, I worked alongside talented professionals who focused on product public relations, corporate affairs and the company blog. By working at such an expansive company, I was able to learn about crisis response in real time and even assisted in the creation of a crisis and issues management toolkit. Additionally, I learned the company's data analytics program to provide insight for future projects across all teams. By the end of my summer, I was excited to share my well-rounded experience with my classes during my senior year and apply my learnings to my future career.

More so, it became extremely apparent to me how critical communication is in ensuring that multinational corporations can operate efficiently wherever they’re present. As an intern focusing on global digital communications I had the chance to see how data science is becoming an increasingly dynamic and exciting space to work in as a public affairs professional. Being able to understand the science behind how individuals interact with messaging so that you can increase people’s understanding of your company is pivotal. As I continue my professional development, the understanding I have been able to gain as a result of working in an evolving media environment for multinational corporation will continue to offer me an invaluable perspective going forward.” Caroline Curran B.A. Public Relations and Strategic Communication; B.A. Corporate Communication and Public Affairs/Political; minor in Law and Legal Reasoning ’19 "My internship experiences have prepared me for life beyond graduation in ways I never could have imagined. From the Washington, D.C.-based Twenty-First Century Group, I learned valuable skills in congressional and client relations, even creating materials to aid in winning a $15 million grant for one of our clients. As an external affairs intern at the George W. Bush Presidential Center (Dallas), I assisted the editor in chief with transcription of interviews for their new book, Listening to Leaders, including an interview with former President George W. Bush. At The Power Group, I have learned the ins and outs of media relations. From pitching stories to providing on-site assistance at interviews and television segments, the experience I gained has shaped me into the well-rounded student and professional I am today. Upon graduation, I am excited to begin my career as an account coordinator with RKD Group, a leading fundraising and marketing agency to over 250 regional and national nonprofits."

Introduced to QMobius and its CEO, Carolyn Covey Morris, by Professor Sandra Duhé, I immediately felt a sense of camaraderie and a collaborative atmosphere, something that can be a rare find in today’s market. I worked on national accounts like HomeTeam Pest Defense, writing for social media and creating fact sheets for their customers. For Nissan and INFINITI Financial Services, I supported the team for customer and consumer research and assisted in upgrading communications to improve their customers’ journey; we also worked on videos to welcome new customers and to help customers through the end-of-lease experience. The QMobius team cares for each other and their clients. Successes are shared, and impediments are treated as reminders for constant improvement and refinement. The internship was a whirlwind, but few companies afford their interns the experiences and responsibilities that QMobius did. I am grateful for that." [Photo: Shaya Gaziani, left, at lunch with QMobius coworkers.] Beth Rose B.A. Corporate Communication and Public Affairs/Organizational Communication; B.A. Advertising/Digital Media Strategy ’18 (Dec.) "I had the opportunity to intern with AT&T in summer 2018, primarily working on project management for their sales and service centers. My main project was to find a nonprofit for the centers to partner with and get employees involved in a fun, easy and engaging way. For example, we partnered with Alex’s Lemonade Stand Foundation to have lemonade stands across the country and raise money to fund childhood cancer research. This required me to work with a large group of employees to inform centers about our partnership. Taking what I had learned in my CCPA classes, I was able to effectively communicate with people all across our organization. From visiting employees in our Houston and Austin centers to presenting my ideas to all of the chiefs of staff in my organization, I was able to get a good idea of what AT&T’s sales and service centers do and why they’re important. One of the most significant things I am taking away from this internship is that you need to love the company you work for. If you love the culture and the people you work with, it doesn’t feel like work at all." Yamleque Murillo B.A. Public Relations & Strategic Communication ’18 “At LDWW Group, I was able to grow professionally and personally. I felt more than prepared to take on my tasks as an intern thanks to the knowledge I gained from my CCPA classes. During my internship experience I realized how much the CCPA classes really mimic real-world public relations work, as nothing I was assigned was ever completely unfamiliar. At LDWW I worked on many client projects that ranged from sending out pitches, tracking media coverage, and event planning, to creating a crisis communications plan for a beverage company client! I feel satisfied knowing that I will continue using the skills learned in my CCPA classes on a daily basis in my career and future endeavors.” Courtney Baptiste B.A. Public Relations and Strategic Communication; B.A. Corporate Communication and Public Affairs/Political Communication ’17 (Dec.) “My classes in the CCPA department helped me find my passion for digital marketing, which I was able to apply at my internship as a social media and public relations intern at Ten90Success. The CCPA curriculum allows you to pursue so many different specializations within public relations. This allowed me to develop videography skills, which really differentiated me within my internship. Throughout my time at Ten90Success, I had opportunities to do everything from strategic planning to video production and editing. In addition, I was able to work closely with clients, which helped me to further develop my professional communication skills, which will be an asset as I move forward in my career.” Gabby Greig B.A. in Public Relations and Strategic Communication ’17 “I felt prepared coming into my internship at Bratskeir & Company, a public relations firm in New York City, because of the knowledge I gained in my Meadows classes over the past three years at SMU. Prior to the internship I had worked with clients in the local Dallas area, learned how to write the perfect pitch, prepared public relations strategies and learned all about business literacy, among other skills. At Bratskeir, I got to learn everything that goes into creating a successful event, including connecting with clients and customers leading up to, during and after the event. I also learned first-hand everything about keeping a mutually beneficial relationship between a company and its clients, which is essential for the field I am pursuing.” Andy Embody B.A. Public Relations and Strategic Communication ’17 “I would not have been able to succeed at my internship with the Washington Redskins if not for all of the material I learned in my classes at SMU. The repetition and practice of AP Style writing gave me the tools I needed to succeed in editing and writing various forms of writing such as press releases, bios and fact sheets. This internship gave me a great deal of experience in interacting with members of the media in a professional manner, which is something I will need to continue a career in sports PR.” [Andy also interned with the Dallas Stars in spring 2017.] Natalie Yezbick (B.A. Journalism; B.A. Public Relations and Strategic Communications; and B.A. Communication Studies ’15) Press Assistant for Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) "I wouldn't be working on the Hill without doing internships in different disciplines. Who else but an SMU Meadows student can say they were published on the front page of a newspaper in a top five media market and interned for a past President in the same school year? My professors gave me the tools to be one of the best in any of the fields I could have pursued, and that is the best kind of job security." Emily Grace Walsh (B.A. Public Relations and Strategic Communication ’15), Account Executive, Brynn Bagot Public Relations, Dallas "After two great internships as an undergrad with Weber Shandwick in their Chicago and Dallas offices, I accepted an account executive position at Brynn Bagot Public Relations in Dallas shortly after graduation. I would not have been able to accept this position without the skills I learned in the SMU Communication Studies program. On a daily basis, I consistently use my writing skills, research skills and interpersonal skills to communicate directly with clients." [Emily is now a corporate communications specialist for Mary Kay Inc.] Creative Computation Kyle Baker B.A. Creative Computing; minors in Musical Theatre and Graphic Design ’20 “This past summer I served as the creative intern for MarketScale, a business-to-business marketing firm in downtown Dallas. I worked in the Creative Department doing 3D animation. It was an awesome hands-on experience where I was working on real projects from day one. I learned more about the 3D animation production pipeline through storyboarding, creating photorealistic textures, lighting and doing camera work. My manager worked with me to develop my skills in each of these areas. He showed me how to see things as an animator. Now when I see an object made of something as general as say, plastic, I notice the subtle nuances that give it its own distinct character. For example, I notice its surface’s small imperfections, or the way the light hits it and reflects. This experience was phenomenal and I am so excited to apply what I learned back into my classes this fall.” Eric Miao B.A. Creative Computing, B.A. Computer Science ’20; Second Century Scholar In the summer of 2018, I worked as a web development and design intern at Nickson, LLC. The internship gave me firsthand knowledge on how to transform classroom work to real-world projects. It was an honor to work directly with the management and technology teams at Nickson, headquartered in Dallas with a satellite office in New York City. During my time at Nickson, my main project revolved around the collaborating and developing of Nickson’s new website as well as creating collateral to be used by the chief marketing officer in her marketing campaign. My creative computing and computer science background gave me a strong foundation to think both as an artist and as an engineer. The courses I took at SMU prepared me for the challenges that arose and helped me deliver projects through effective communication and collaboration. The work forced me to be extremely detail oriented and diligent in every task presented. Overall, my internship enhanced my hard and soft skills and made me a better person going forward. Stejara Dinulescu B.A. Creative Computing, B.A. Studio Art, B.S. Psychology ’19; President's Scholar, Meadows Scholar In summer 2018, I began researching the self-referential effect and its relation with aspects of social cognition through SMU's Psychology Department. This work is through the Social and Clinical Neuroscience lab, led by Dr. Benjamin Tabak. Before I was able to begin running statistical analyses, I had to sort and process tens of thousands of data points from our large research study conducted over the past year. Instead of spending weeks completing this manually, I was able to write a program in a few hours to automate this process with practically no error, giving me the desired data in less than a second. The creative computing department equipped me with the tools necessary for programming and problem-solving, not only in this more statistical, data-oriented realm but also in the domains of art, artificial intelligence and video game creation. One example is “Drawing with Movement,” which takes accelerometer data input from Wii remotes strapped to ballroom dancers, processes it through a Markov chain (basic probabilistic artificial intelligence) and draws lines on-screen based on their movement. The result is an interactive performance that illustrates the pure movement of the dancers as well as an autonomous “bot” that draws on-screen based on the data from the dancers. Eskinder Abebe B.A. Creative Computing ’18 “Working for the SMU Hunter and Stephanie Hunt Institute for Engineering and Humanity has been a unique experience because it incorporates different disciplines where scientists, professors and students work together to solve humanitarian issues locally and globally. My main task working there was to develop an affordable computer tablet for remote locations where education is scarce. I was also privileged to work toward the mission and goal of the Institute. In addition, I have been creating visual assets for the Institute, like logo design, brochures, flyers and posters.” Kali Ruppert B.A. Creative Computing; B.A. Art History ’16 "Last summer I worked for the design sector of SAP in Palo Alto, specifically with d.forum, the chief design officer's initiative to bring design thinking into global organizations. I also co-facilitated design thinking workshops for SAP University Alliances at the Stanford d.school, SAP, the Hanahaus in downtown Palo Alto and Delaware State University. Design thinking closely aligned with my studies at SMU, particularly my arts entrepreneurship minor. In fact, I integrated Professor Jim Hart's game, "Speed Dating Market Feedback," into several workshops. My managers and SAP clients were also very intrigued by the Creative Computing major." [Kali is now a creative technologist with RP3 Agency in Washington, D.C.] Harley Swick B.A. Creative Computing ’16 "My internship at PricewaterhouseCoopers gave me a taste of the real world and how effective my skills could be at a professional level. It was a great experience. The skills I've gained at SMU really came in handy in the workplace and the hands-on learning that I got in the Creative Computing Center gave me quite the edge. My recruitment process included a personal recommendation from my professor. Without that connection, I never would have had such a great opportunity. The best takeaway I got from the internship is a very nice offer to work at PwC when I graduate." [Harley is now an associate with PricewaterhouseCoopers.] Emely Villeda-Principe B.A. Creative Computing; B.A. Computer Science ’17 "I interned in the AT&T TDP - Emerging Technologies program in summer 2015. The best part about the internship was that I was able to work on projects specific to my interest in UI/UX Development, which greatly helped me improve my skills. Thanks to my C3 professors, I can approach problems as both an artist and programmer to take on projects that require creativity and logic." [Upon graduation, Emely began working as an associate application developer in AT&T’s software development program.] Dance Emily Slater BFA in Dance Performance; minors in Business and in Educational Studies ’22 Going into my first year at Southern Methodist University, I knew that I needed to find a complementary career path to dance and was able to utilize the online classes offered in summer 2020 to obtain a business minor. Eager and nervous, I submitted my application to American Ballet Theatre in New York. Meanwhile, I was working with Silas Farley in preparation for our Hope Show. One night I realized that Silas, a former New York City Ballet dancer, may have a connection at ABT. I decided to meet with him and talk about the opportunity. Silas was glad to help and extremely supportive of my endeavor. A few interviews later, I was offered the position in May! As the end of June was approaching, so was the premiere of the ABT Summer Celebration! For this event, I worked alongside my mentors in weekly meetings as well as emailing and documenting hundreds of donors. During this event, Silas Farley’s work Collage and Creed premiered. Before the premiere, I was honored to attend multiple zoom rehearsals and watch him create on the ABT company! Kendall Lockhart B.F.A. Dance ’19 “I had the wonderful opportunity to perform on tour in South Africa as a cast member of Wading Home, a beautiful opera about the tragedy of Hurricane Katrina. As an individual preparing to dance professionally for a dance company after college, I was eager to experience dancing on tour for the first time in a place as cultural and historically rich as South Africa. This trip impacted and enriched me professionally, artistically and spiritually. I performed at three different universities in Port Elizabeth, Cape Town and Pretoria. I learned how to travel, communicate with various types of people and how to remain a responsible and accountable company member. In my free time, I saw a multitude of incredible views, enjoyed a farm-to-table breakfast at a vineyard and toured important landmarks relating to the history of Apartheid. It both humbled and inspired me to work closely with South African university students and SMU vocal artists and musicians in collaboration. I developed deep relationships in just two weeks with people I otherwise would have never met.” Kat Barragan B.F.A. Dance Performance, B.A. History 2017 “To me, the Movement Exchange Program stands out as the most special and rare thing the Meadows Dance Division has to offer: Not only are you going on a service trip to orphanages throughout Panama, but you also get to experience classes in salsa, modern dance, aerial, and other Panamanian types of dance, with local dancers. Our guides were fellow dancers who had grown up in Panama, and for one week, they immersed us in Panama’s culture. It would be difficult to choose one memory from the trip, but my personal favorite was taking an improvisation modern class with a professional dance company in Panama City. We were given a partner for one exercise, and although I spoke awful Spanish, my partner and I were able to communicate solely through our bodies in the dance: Dance itself became connective language. I have never felt so in love with my art as I did in that moment.” [Photo: Kat, front row on the right, with fellow dancers on the beach in Panama.] Fallon Reedy B.F.A. Dance Performance ’17 “For two years now, I’ve spent my summers in downtown Dallas working for Larrwell Productions as a contracted dancer for Mary Kay’s corporate seminars held at the Kay Bailey Hutchins Convention Center. It has been such a fulfilling and worthwhile experience for me, benefiting my professionalism and diversity as an artist in so many ways. I not only learned firsthand how to conduct myself as a working professional, but I was also exposed to the incredible benefits of working in a more industrial setting, such as backup dancing for major performing artists. Dancing for Mary Kay was also a great platform that allowed me to work with other young professionals in and around the Dallas area. My training from Meadows definitely prepared me for an experience like this, especially in terms of the audition process. The audition experience I receive at SMU is a direct representation of what to expect in the real world, and for that preparation I’m very grateful.” [Photo: Fallon, right, at Mary Kay event with Sarah Larr of Larrwell Productions.] Molly Kate Dalton B.F.A. Dance Performance ’18 During spring break I traveled to Panama through the Movement Exchange organization. We taught dance to kids ages 5-15 who were living in orphanages. Although the language barrier was a challenge at first, within a few days we were all brought together through our love of movement, and we witnessed moments of pure bliss. My return to the States made me realize there is so much more to dance than meets the eye: It is a passion, a way of expression, and it is the universal language. My dance professors at SMU teach from a place of passion, heart and encouragement, which have helped me grow as a dancer and a person. I can only hope that I have touched someone’s life in the way my professors and peers have touched mine. Mallory Ketch B.F.A. Dance Performance Dec. 2015 Dancing in the Bruce Wood Dance Project's "5 Years" show advanced my knowledge of the professional dance world. I experienced tremendous growth in my technique, my knowledge of professionalism as an artist and my ability to adapt to new choreographic ideas. I brought my experiences from this inspiring environment back into my work as a dance major at SMU. I also will never forget dancing in the José Limón Festival at the Joyce Theater in New York City with the Division of Dance. These opportunities have shaped me tremendously as a dancer, positively influencing my work at SMU and preparing me for a successful career in dance. Emily Bernet B.F.A. Dance Performance ’16 Outside of Meadows Division of Dance, I have had the incredible opportunity to perform with Dark Circles Contemporary Dance USA, directed by SMU alumni Joshua L. Peugh. Working with DCCD has given me valuable professional experience, teaching me the challenges and rewards of being a part of a professional dance company. In addition to performing in Dallas, I have toured with the company to New York, Houston, Austin and the Jacob’s Pillow Dance Festival in Massachusetts, where we met and performed alongside inspiring artists from all over America and abroad. Rehearsing and performing with the company has allowed me to put all of the training I have gained at SMU into practice in a professional environment and become more involved in the Dallas dance community.

Film and Media Arts; minor in arts management ’20 "After working as a seasonal guest services worker at Live Nation Entertainment – a national live events promoter and music venue operator – at the Dallas Dos Equis Pavilion over summer 2018, I applied for and was offered their operation internship for the 2019 concert season. I learned how to manage stress, both my own and other people’s; how to take the reins of a situation even if it is “above your pay grade”; and witnessed first-hand the delicacy it takes to manage all of the moving parts in such a complex machine. I also learned what a truly phenomenal manager looks like. These experiences taught me to try things. Through it all, I was offered a third internship with Live Nation Productions, their movie production branch in Los Angeles, a place where my love for music and film meet in the middle." Aggie Ryan B.F.A. Film and Media Arts ’20, minor in arts management "Filmmaking is more than just "Lights! Camera! Action!" I had a strong suspicion of this after seven semesters pursuing a B.F.A. in Film and Media Arts and a minor in Arts Management, but it was never so fully confirmed than during my 2019 summer internship at Valiant Pictures, a boutique production company in downtown Manhattan where I experienced firsthand the detailed preparation and hard work required to produce commercials, shorts and feature films. In the office, I read pre-production books, treatments and scripts, and also assisted with editing. On set, I worked as a PA [production assistant] on four commercials and as a second camera assistant on a short film. Beyond general know-how and professional set etiquette, I received advice from my supervisors, including DIT [digital imaging technician] recommendations and tips on how to pitch a script. I'm thankful to have had this opportunity to explore NYC's film scene, learn the day-to-day of production and apply professionalism to my projects." Maci Mallahan (B.A. Film & Media Arts, B.A. Markets and Culture ’19 [Dec.]) During fall semester 2017 I interned at the Dallas Film Society (DFS) in the Educational Outreach department. DFS is a nonprofit organization, and part of what they do is set up workshops and Q&As for high school students in the Dallas area. I was responsible for keeping up with which schools would be attending the events. I also helped put on the events and learned from each speaker. DFS also puts on screenings for the public and I helped the team introduce two of the screenings that semester. One was a screening of “Bram Stoker’s Dracula” (1992) for DFS members. At the screening I was introduced to James V. Hart, who wrote the screenplay and the scripts for “Hook,” “Contact,” “August Rush” and many more. He grew up in the same city as me and graduated from SMU. While interning with the Dallas Film Society, they helped me realize there are more careers in film besides being behind the camera. [Photo: Maci Mallahan, left; James V. Hart, right; fellow Dallas Film Society intern, center.] Natalie Khraish B.A. Film and Media Arts ’17 “In summer 2016 I was chosen by the department to be an intern for AFI’s Directing Workshop for Women in Los Angeles. I was also informed of the generous donation I would receive to help pay for my travel and lodging expenses. I can say without a doubt that it was the best experience of my life. I got to work on several different independent film sets, meet and learn from industry professionals, and explore and live in Los Angeles – one of the most amazing cities in the world. This internship allowed me to observe and also be a part of some of the most intricate and professional film sets I have ever seen. I met so many people and made invaluable connections that will surely help me enter the industry once I graduate.” Lawrence Jiang B.F.A. Film & Media Arts; B.B.A. Management ’17 “During summer 2016 I interned at WWE Studios in L.A. I gained exposure to the several stages of production, from reading and analyzing scripts for prospective projects to observing editors put together different cuts for feature films. Through my internship at WWE Studios, I learned how to work in a professional movie studio, became better acquainted with getting around in L.A., and gained insight into what job positions to pursue after graduation. Prior to doing the internship I took Media Career Preparation, which helped me prepare an impressive résumé and cover letter that helped me land this internship.” [Lawrence also held an internship with the American Pavilion at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival.] Janay Higgins B.A in Interdisciplinary Studies ’17 “During summer 2016 I had the opportunity to intern at charlieuniformtango – Dallas in their audio department. During my time there I worked on several projects for companies like American Airlines, Choctaw Nation and Johnson Brothers. Some of my responsibilities were assisting in recording sessions and with editing/mixing audio in Pro Tools. From this experience I gained necessary skills and learned best practices used in the audio field. My courses in Meadows gave me the experience and knowledge needed to hit the ground running on the projects and in my career.” Kim Kooker B.A. Film & Media Arts; B.B.A. Marketing ’17 During fall 2015 of my junior year I had the amazing opportunity to intern at The Levenson Group on their Paramount Pictures, CBS Films and Warner Bros. accounts. My duties included planning local promotional events, staffing advanced screenings, distributing promotional materials and partnering with local businesses to promote the films. I handled the grassroots promotions for about 10 films and gained valuable insight into the field marketing strategies of three very different studios. The most important thing I learned from the experience was that you can be an integral part of the marketing and release of a film by working on the ground level in a large city like Dallas - you don't necessarily have to be in L.A. (Photo from Wicklow National Park in Ireland during the summer when Kim studied abroad in London.) Samantha Doctor B.A. Film & Media Arts ’17 During summer 2015 I interned for Paramount Pictures within their World Wide Marketing group. During my nine weeks working in L.A., I gained exposure to qualitative marketing research, presentations made for marketing strategy, and editing print and video advertising content. The program offered seminars on how the entertainment industry works within a large studio. The entire experience gave me a huge perspective on which avenues I would like to pursue, and a fun summer in a new city! By working with Meadows faculty, I was given the tools and alumni connections to land this great opportunity. Journalism Sara Magalio B.A. Journalism, B.F.A. Dance Performance ’19 In the fall 2018 semester, I worked as a breaking news reporter for The Dallas Morning News. I published numerous articles covering a range of topics, from Dallas crime to the Texas State Fair. This internship challenged me to complete stories on a tight deadline, while also allowing me to become acclimated to working in a professional newsroom. In the spring 2019 semester, I worked as an online editorial assistant for D Magazine. D challenged me to complete lengthier, more thoroughly researched pieces. I specifically covered politics and urban development in Dallas. Both of these internship opportunities have given me invaluable, professional experience in the field that I feel will greatly help me in my future career. Cassidy Najarian B.A. Journalism; B.A. Advertising/Digital Media ’19 [Dec.] In spring of 2019, I worked as a breaking news reporter for The Dallas Morning News. Working at a major newspaper sharpened my writing and communication skills and gave me hands-on experience in a fast-paced environment. A lot of my stories are centered around crime and I often had to analyze police reports or call local police stations to get information. This type of work made me step outside my comfort zone and ultimately made me a better journalist. Maddie Church (B.A. Fashion Media, minor in advertising ’19) “As an intern at Seacrest Studios for the Red Balloon Network at Children’s Health hospital, I gained valuable experience working in broadcast journalism and programming at a multimedia center. During this time, I developed skills in operating the TriCaster and soundboard, as well as hosting on-air radio and game shows. The program is broadcast directly to TVs in every patient’s room to provide entertainment, especially to those who cannot leave their room. It has been a very rewarding experience knowing that I can make a difference doing something I love. This internship has solidified my passion for broadcast journalism and has equipped me with the necessary tools to further explore the industry.” Kelly Kolff (B.A. Journalism, minors in art history and in advertising ’18 [Dec.]) “Spoke Media was single handedly the best internship I’ve ever had to further my journalistic career. From my first day, I was involved in nearly every step of the show creation process. For the summer and fall of 2018, I had the privilege of being a production assistant at Spoke Media, a podcasting company in downtown Dallas. I have always desired to work in the podcasting field and through the day-to-day tasks assigned to me, I mastered the foundation that will help me succeed going forward. Specifically, I had the immense pleasure of working on a podcast dealing with the death of an absent father. Not only did I learn valuable techniques, but also I was challenged to grow emotionally. I was challenged to rise to this professional level, however I feel like I overcame my obstacles and grew in educational, professional and emotional ways.” Morgan Chandler Smith B.A. Journalism ’18 “I had the privilege of interning for Zanna Roberts Rassi, senior fashion editor at Marie Claire Magazine in New York, stylist for Target, and correspondent for E! News and The Today Show. My typical day consisted of assisting with styling on the set of photo and video shoots and researching fashion trends for Zanna’s segments (I even wrote her red carpet questions for the CFDA awards!). The experience provided clarity for my future, both personally and professionally. Working for one of the most influential people in fashion connected me with stylists and businesspeople that I wouldn’t have met otherwise. The glitz and glamour does wear off, but living in the moment and going in with a willingness to learn and experience as much as you can makes every day as good as it can be.” [Morgan also interned her junior year at D CEO magazine.] Macye Marshall B.A. Journalism ’18 “Interning at Seacrest Studios for the Red Balloon Network at Children’s Health hospital was such a rewarding experience. I served as a radio and TV host, worked the TriCaster system and audio board, and set up the visual set before we went live. Not only did I gain further experience that will make me a capable asset in an active news environment, I was also able to impact the lives of the patients and their families who have been hospitalized for long periods of time. While serving as an on-air host of my own radio and television show, the kids became more outgoing and realized how special they are! Using the studio’s professional audio and video broadcast equipment would not have been easy without the help from my Meadows professors. The first day going live I was confident due to all the time and dedication my professors gave me to do my best.” Patrick Engel B.A. Journalism ’17 “I’ve had plenty of great journalism experiences at SMU, but I didn’t work in a newsroom until I spent the summer of 2016 at FOX4 in Dallas as a web producer intern. I wrote news stories for the station’s website, fox4news.com. My writing speed and story organization skills improved a lot, but the most valuable part for me was working the day after the July 7 police shootings in Dallas. That experience showed me how “real” the coverage was and how important professional coverage is to breaking news. To experience and be part of the coverage was incredible. Through my internship I was guided by SMU alum Mark Norris, the station’s senior web producer.” India Pougher B.A. Journalism, B.A. Fashion Media ’17 “Working in the beauty closet at Marie Claire in New York City, I learned the ins and outs of magazine production, as well as the beauty and fashion industries. Throughout the summer I took part in writing, reporting, market work, social media production and other creative projects, and interacted with editors across multiple departments. With encouragement and advice from fashion media professors Camille Kraeplin and Jayne Suhler I embarked on one of the best experiences of my life. This internship solidified my desire to work in fashion media after graduation, and has put me so much closer to that goal.” [Copy and paste to see India’s journalism and fashion media website: https://indiapougher.wordpress.com] Natalia Bru B.A. Journalism ’17 "My whole life I've had one goal: to run/produce late night television. When I interned at "Entertainment Tonight" and "The Insider" with CBS in L.A., I was introduced to Stephen Colbert by "The Insider" host Louis Aguirre. Colbert told me to never give up on my dreams and to strive for excellence. He got to meet David Letterman, who told him maybe one day he would be taking over Letterman's chair ... and he did! My summer wouldn't have been possible without the guidance and help of professors Michele Houston and Pam Harris Hackett. They both push me to do my best." [Natalia also interned at “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” in summer 2016.] Ashley Almquist B.A. Journalism ’16 "I interned at CBS Television Studios for "Entertainment Tonight" and "The Insider" in Studio City, Calif. I got to work on all aspects of production for both shows. I transcribed interviews, ran scripts to talent, prepared post-shoot updates, gathered content for the shows and even acted as production assistant at the 2015 Teen Choice Awards. This summer was a great experience because the journalism professors had really prepared me for this opportunity." [Ashley is now a social media manager for the APA Agency in Beverly Hills.] Music Greg Eckhardt M.M. in Musicology ’20 "When I try to explain to someone what musicology is, I tend to say that I "read and write about music." While this is true, I often leave out the many steps that go into becoming a musicologist. Presenting at conferences is just one of these steps. In the past year I've had the opportunity to present at three different conferences, including the New England chapter of the American Musicological Society. Presenting at conferences yields a variety of experiences, most notably the connections one makes when at an event such as this one. This journey will continue as my graduate career continues, but without the support I've received from my professors at Meadows I wouldn't be where I am today. Teaching me the skills that I need to succeed has proved paramount in this academic journey." [In spring 2020 Eckhardt presented a paper at the University of North Texas GAMuT Student Conference on Gustav Mahler and Alfred Roller's 1903-07 Vienna Court Opera productions.] Nicolas Farmer B.M. Composition/Horn Performance ’20 "In July 2019, I attended the Analysis, Creation, and Teaching of Orchestration Conference at IRCAM in Paris, France. At the sponsorship of former Meadows Musicology Professor Zachary Wallmark, and in addition to networking with many composers and musicologists, I presented my research on the esoteric orchestration techniques Alexander Scriabin used in his late orchestral music and how they influenced later composers in the early 20th century. At the conference I received valuable feedback on my ongoing research, and I am grateful for the opportunity to pursue a research interest of mine beyond composition and horn during my undergraduate career at Meadows." Julia Baca B.M. Performance/Viola, B.M. Music Education ’20 “As a musician, I’ve always found it important to be familiar with as many aspects of a performance as possible. A lot must happen before a performance entertains an audience, and this internship has shown me how successful an institution can be at building relationships with its patrons and producing high-quality publications with limited time, while maintaining professionalism and passion for the task at hand. As an intern, I had the privilege of contributing ideas and edits to the annual program book, season brochure, social media initiatives and first-ever television commercial. This unforgettable summer has allowed me to contribute to the many successes at the Santa Fe Opera and further cemented my passion for yet another part of the music industry.” Abigail Hawthorne B.M. Performance/Oboe, B.A. Psychology ’18 “In summer 2017, I played with the National Repertory Orchestra in Breckenridge, Colo. Over the course of eight weeks, we performed in 21 full orchestra concerts as well as smaller-scale chamber music outreach events in the beautiful Summit County community. I learned so much through my collaboration with music director Carl Topilow, guest conductors, and my talented colleagues within the orchestra. We played fantastic programs of pieces from the standard classical music repertoire, as well as popular music programs including patriotic music for the Fourth of July, the music of “Star Wars,” and family concerts aimed toward introducing children to the instruments of the orchestra. I had a wonderful summer and grew so much as a musician and artistic community member!” [Photo: Abigail, left, with members of the NRO oboe section.] Mary Lena Bleile B.M. Performance/Cello ’18 “I'm a student researcher in Meadows’ MuSci Cognition Lab. I got the wonderful opportunity to attend the Methods in Empirical Music Research workshop at Ohio State University, where I learned from one of America's leading musicologists! Dr. David Huron's workshop was incredibly inspiring and informative, something that definitely helped develop my skills and expand my breadth of knowledge of current research. It was also such a pleasure to be around the 14 other like-minded workshop attendees. I'd highly recommend this workshop to anyone interested in empirical music research.” Isaiah Pennington B.M. Performance/Cello ’18 "As a member of Bridge the Gap Chamber Players (BTG), I have witnessed the small student-run nonprofit transform into a strong force for arts advocacy in Dallas due to the hard work of dedicated Meadows students. We have been able to help start a youth orchestra for underprivileged students in South Dallas, forming a close relationship with the kids we teach and the community where we work. Meadows is invaluable at preparing its students for the kind of entrepreneurial and pedagogical work BTG does. The faculty at Meadows equip students with the kind of real-world skills needed to create a thriving arts organization and personal career.” [Photo: Isaiah with students at Dunbar Elementary.] Alexis Nguyen B.M. Music Education ’17 “In the summer of 2016, I was the Operations Intern and House Manager for Music@Menlo, a Chamber Music Festival and Institute, in Menlo Park/Atherton, California. I absolutely loved my time in the Bay Area. I was able to network with not only Music@Menlo artists but also people interning from around the globe. By working closely with the administrative staff, production crew and artists, I gained hands-on experience running a festival. The high quality of musicianship, professionalism and overall rigor of the Meadows School prepares its students for this field of work.” Nilsa Pozo B.M. Music Therapy ’17 In summer 2016 I researched the uses of music therapy to support individuals in their weight loss efforts by working with a group of 11 women in a private medical office in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Each week I led group sessions to address behavioral and emotional barriers to weight loss and provide 30 minutes of drumming and exercise. The experience challenged me to use every musical and therapeutic skill I have learned from my professors in the MUTY program. It was immensely rewarding to see how the interventions motivated participants to take control of the weight loss process and enjoy it at the same time. The results of the study have inspired me to improve my clinician skills and conduct further research on this topic. Vinnie Mahal B.M. Vocal Performance ’17 Last spring I had the wonderful opportunity to collaborate with the Voices of Change chamber music ensemble on "Tibet Fantasia," composed by SMU Associate Professor of Music Composition and Theory Xi Wang. It was a wonderful but very challenging experience as I had never before sung any modern classical music. It challenged my musicianship abilities, but getting to work with Dr. Xi and Professor of Voice Virginia Dupuy helped me immensely. Professor Dupuy taught me valuable lessons in vocal technique, pitch reference and the importance of preparation in the professional world. For that, I am very grateful. Moretta Irchirl B.M. Music Therapy, B.M. Vocal Performance ’16 The Music Therapy program has given me the great honor of working at My Possibilities, a continuing education facility for adults with disabilities. Each week, I do one-on-one and group music therapy sessions with the HIPsters (Highly Important People) to help improve their everyday life skills. It is an amazing experience to see them function at a higher level when participating in personalized musical activities. With this hands-on experience, I am learning and implementing new therapeutic techniques that I will use for the rest of my career as a music therapist. Lawson Malnory B.M. Music Education ’17 The motivational environment created by Meadows inspiring professors led me to found my own nonprofit, Helping Hand Drums. Meadows has equally inspiring students, such as those who lead and allow me to be a part of Bridge the Gap Chamber Players, which brings great student musicians out to the community, and the South Dallas Strings project, a music education program for elementary students in South Dallas. Meadows is a great place to learn how to"do more" with your craft than just perform on stage or hang something on a wall. You learn how to build the stage, and make the wall, and bring it to the community. [In addition to serving as the president of Dallas’s Bridge the Gap Chamber Players, Lawson also interned with the Dallas Symphony Orchestra in 2016 and 2017.] Theatre Josh Whittington-Manning M.F.A. in Design ’21 "I had the honor of collaborating with Lindsay Silva (M.F.A. '19) on a number of shows she designed for Jubilee Theater in Fort Worth, Texas. Assisting her was such a treat because it brought me two opportunities: One, we have very different styles, so I got to learn new lighting design techniques from her, many of which I would have never considered on my own. Two, I was able to broaden my network by working with the artistic director, director and other designers at Jubilee. Working with Lindsay and the Jubilee accelerated my development as a designer." Janice Rabian M.F.A. in Design ’21 "I was the assistant costume designer on Public Works Dallas 2019 working with NYC-based costume designer Lex Liang, who designed costumes for over 100 cast members. I helped create the design of the production. Lex was a wonderful mentor, and gave me a lot of creative freedom and leadership opportunities. I worked closely with the equity actors and community members in fittings and during the tech process. I also worked as an associate costume designer to Professor Claudia Stephens on Cape Fear Regional Theatre's production of "Mamma Mia!" I led creative discussions and collaborated with the CFRT team, the NYC director and NYC choreographer to create a fresh and modern take on this '90s jukebox classic. I led the production process, working closely with the shop manager and professional actors to fit the production. The production was fabulous and sparkly and I walked away from the experience with a great portfolio piece and a new professional network." Stakiah Washington B.F.A. Theatre Studies ’21 I had the honor of going to New York City to be in the Stella Adler Black Art Intensive. The six-week intensive took place at the legendary Billie Holiday Theatre in Brooklyn. Besides making lifelong friends, I also had the opportunity to network with well-known actors. Several of the workshops included scene study, monologue work, African dancing, wellness and mental health for artists, music, playwriting and business management in the theatre industry. I had the opportunity of being trained by Ruben Santiago-Hudson, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Michele Shay, Harry Lennix and many more. Through this program I have gained great knowledge and understanding of myself, my craft and those who have come before me. Rose Cobey M.F.A. in Design ’20 “I was a lighting intern at Cincinnati Opera—the second-oldest opera company in the U.S.—over the course of the five-show season. During that time, I worked with Thomas Hase, a truly world-famous opera designer, as an intern, second assistant and assistant lighting designer (ALD). It was an exceptional opportunity to experience a prestigious opera company from the inside out, as well as to work with one of the best in the business. My duties were wide-ranging, including traditional ALD tasks such as drafting light plots, as well as unexpected responsibilities such as handling quotes and bids from suppliers. The internship focused almost as much on running a department as it did on design. The most memorable part was working as Thomas’s ALD on a brand-new opera called ‘Blind Injustice,’ commissioned by Cincinnati Opera and based on the Ohio Innocence Project.” Bri Tobin M.F.A. in Design ’20 "My fellowship at the Hangar Theatre in Ithaca, New York, really kickstarted my design career! In the span of a few months I participated in the Hangar’s competitive “design boot camp,” designing two children’s plays, two experimental plays in a shared art space, and assisting New York City designers on three productions. The first few weeks were rigorous as we had a short time to collaborate and pitch full designs to the company’s artistic director. To accomplish this, we roomed in a communal living space with our design teams and directing fellows. It was such a unique and fun experience to collaborate day and night with other young professionals. One of the most rewarding parts of the fellowship was the opportunity to workshop with eight successful designers whose credits ranged from Broadway to international opera houses. The fellowship was intense, but I will never forget the skills and confidence I gained!" Coda Boyce B.F.A. Theatre/Acting ’20 I attended SpringboardNYC with The American Theatre Wing, a program that introduces theatre students to life in New York City. I learned what it was like to thrive as an actor and pursue the career I was meant for. I attended nine Broadway productions and the Tony Awards! I talked with well-known actors such as Jeremy Pope, Cynthia Erivo, Patti LuPone, and LaTanya Richardson Jackson, who gave some very encouraging advice. We worked all day at Pearl Studios, only blocks away from amazing theatres. We took the subway every morning (the MTA is not your friend), attended workshops and master classes all day, and ended our nights with a show. SpringboardNYC teaches you that the work never stops after graduation, you must keep perfecting your craft by taking classes and seeing shows and going out for auditions. I built so many connections at this program that not only am I excited but I’m also incredibly prepared to make my journey to the Big Apple in 2020. Yvonne Johnson (M.F.A. Stage Design ’20) “My internship through the Television Academy in Los Angeles for costume design was one of the most epic experiences of my life! I was assigned to Bill Hargate Costumes, the facility that builds the costumes for Marvel as well as for ‘American Horror Story,’ DC’s ‘Superman,’ the new Quentin Tarantino film starring Brad Pitt and a host of other film, television and theatre productions. I got to go on set and see them film the last episode of ‘Strange Angel,’ a CBS streaming show, attend Comic-Con in San Diego where I met Ruth Carter, the costume designer of Marvel’s ‘Black Panther,’ and went costume shopping with Michelle Cole, Emmy-nominated costume designer for ABC’s ‘Black-ish.’ The Television Academy also held networking events for around 60 interns that included a behind-the-scenes experience with HBO’s ‘Game of Thrones’ process. I made some great connections and even received an invitation to the Creative Arts Emmy awards! I can’t wait to go back and see all my idols receive recognition for their great work and hope to one day get to stand in their shoes.” [Photo: Yvonne Johnson, left, with Ruth E. Carter, costume designer of Marvel’s “Black Panther.” Carter is also known for her costume designs for “Malcolm X,” “Roots” (TV series), “Amistad,” “Selma” and multiple additional television shows and films.] Kassy Amoi B.F.A. Theatre ’18 “In my work for Ignite/Arts Dallas, I collaborated with Public Works Dallas as a teacher's assistant and company member of the Dallas Theatre Center 2017 production of ‘The Tempest.’ The production involved over 150 actors from throughout the Dallas community and was a collaboration between SMU Meadows, Ignite/Arts Dallas and Dallas Theater Center, in affiliation with New York City’s The Public Theater’s Public Works and Dallas’s AT&T Performing Arts Center. I continue to work for Ignite/Arts Dallas as both a student and artist to learn more about my community in the most fulfilling way possible. The lessons I learn never disappoint me.” Leslie Ballart B.F.A. Theatre/Acting ’17 “I worked with Public Works Dallas as a community liaison during “The Tempest” at Dallas Theater Center. This was an incredible opportunity to connect with community members from various backgrounds. I worked with people who never thought they would be involved in a professional production along with those who’ve been theater professionals for most of their lives. Helping non-English speaking cast members by using my first language, Spanish -- which I hadn’t utilized in-depth in a long time -- was extremely gratifying. This experience has opened my eyes and heart to the extraordinary power of theatre. Watching others achieve their dreams, face new challenges and inspire their community has in turn inspired me to go after my own dreams once I graduate, and reconfirmed why I love theatre.” Christina Sittser B.F.A. Theatre/Theatre Studies ’17 (Minors in: Fashion Media, European Studies, History of Visual & Performing Arts) “I was an actress and assistant teaching artist for Public Works Dallas, and boy was it a great experience! I got to teach acting classes at two community centers, and my students were so much fun. Then, together with professionals from Dallas Theater Center and over 150 other Dallasites, we put on a beautiful production of Shakespeare’s “The Tempest.” On our last day, I felt like my heart was being ripped out because I’d made so many friends. It’s okay, though, because we’ve kept in touch! That was my seventh professional theatre job while enrolled at SMU. Who knew I’d feel this ready to graduate and get out there?!” (Photo by Susan Hamilton) Haley Nelson B.F.A. Theatre/Theatre Studies ’17 "My liberal arts and theatre classes were equally important during my internship at the Ko Festival in Amherst, Massachusetts. I worked on solo performances and devised theatre pieces, many of which focused on social justice issues including urban violence, mass incarceration and the refugee crisis. My non-theatre classes helped me converse knowledgeably about these issues in the rehearsal room with an international cast and crew, and my playwriting, solo performance and tech classes allowed me to assume technical roles and script development opportunities with ease. My internship combined my passions for theatre and politics, and taught me about successfully producing touring theatre." Diggle M.F.A. in Design ’16 I am the primary scenic associate for Clint Ramos, a Broadway scenic and costume designer. Together, we have collaborated on over 13 productions. Most recently, we opened "Slave Play" on Broadway and we are about to open another Broadway show, "Grand Horizons." Working as his associate designer has not only propelled my knowledge as a designer but has acted as a catalyst for my own design career. I am now a union designer in the IATSE Scenic Artist Union Local 829 and I am represented by an agent at Abrams Artists Agency. Tiana Johnson M.F.A. Acting ’16 "Working in the Dallas area with professional theater companies such as Dallas Theater Center has given me the opportunity to gain professional experience and a chance to meet fellow actors working within the community. It presents me with many options of what a career in the arts could look like and connections that will launch me into my career. SMU Meadows has prepared me to know what is expected of me when I step into a room under the title of an actor or an artist." Sasha Davis B.F.A. Theatre Studies ’16 "I had great experiences working with a national Dallas Faces Race conference, which focuses on shifting the racial imbalance in our country. Playwrights from nine Dallas theatre companies wrote 10-minute plays based off a prompt about the Trayvon Martin shooting. I served as production manager for the readings as well as an actor and was paid for both. The plays were later produced at the Kitchen Dog Theatre, which was founded by SMU alums, three of whom I've been lucky enough to call my teachers. Both experiences exposed me to a completely different side of theatre that is very different from acting; both introduced me to wonderful artists in the greater Dallas area." Dylan Guerra B.F.A Theater ’16 "I worked with the Dallas Theater Center as an assistant director on the play "The School for Wives" by Moliere. Through this experience I gained knowledge and hands-on experience on directing in the professional world. I also learned how to run a rehearsal room and work with not only actors, but also designers and crew. My classes in Meadows really prepared me for the challenges in directing at a professional theater and I always felt prepared and ready for whatever task I needed to perform. After working with DTC, I now have several connections and perhaps even job opportunities when I graduate and have no doubt I will be able to practice my craft in the real world."

If you left on probation, you will return on probation. All holds must be cleared prior to enrollment. Returning students are responsible for meeting all financial aid, housing and advising deadlines. After nonattendance for two regular (fall, spring) terms, students who formerly attended are required to apply for reactivation. Students who were suspended from SMU must apply for reinstatement. If you intend to return to SMU, regardless of whether you are required to apply for reinstatement, you are encouraged to notify the appropriate University departments as soon as possible to ensure timely processing of enrollment, financial aid, housing and other documents. Transcripts If you attended any college or university after leaving SMU, you must forward official transcripts from each college or university attended since your last enrollment at SMU. If five years or more have elapsed since your last term of enrollment at SMU, you must also forward official transcripts from each college or university attended prior to SMU to the Division of Enrollment Services. Transfer courses from another institution Once you have matriculated at SMU, you may transfer up to 30 hours to SMU from an accredited, four year institution. Any course to be transferred must have the prior approval of the chair of the department and dean of the school at SMU that normally offers the course, the adviser and the student's dean. You must obtain these approvals before taking any such courses. Petitions to attend another college or university during the summer must be completed and approved in advance to ensure that proper credit is awarded. Petition forms are available in the Undergraduate Offices. You are responsible for making sure that a transcript of all transfer work attempted is sent to the University registrar immediately following completion of the work. PLEASE NOTE: ALL post-matriculation transfer work must be completed at accredited, four-year institution. It is imperative that you petition ALL post-matriculation transfer courses PRIOR to enrollment in courses using the Undergraduate Petition for Advance Approval of Transfer Credit. Student can also complete/submit a paper version of this form here. Students who fail to get prior approval for transfer work have no assurances that they will receive credit for their courses. Academic forgiveness Any academic work taken 10 or more years prior to the term of admission or reinstatement may be forgiven, and excluded from your GPA calculation or hours earned to determine your eligibility for admission, academic probation, suspension, honors and graduation. Name change If your name has changed since your last enrollment at SMU, or if your name changes from the name submitted on your application for admission, you must provide your Social Security card or the form issued by the U.S. Social Security Administration. Without these documents, you cannot be enrolled under your new name. All grade reports, transcripts, and diplomas are issued only under your legal name as recorded by the University registrar.

It’s important to know the grad school application deadline for your program. Most programs are making funding considerations based on that timeline, and you’ll have the best chance if all of your items are submitted by that date.Some programs operate on a priority deadline and a space available deadline. Others have just one deadline. Be sure that you’ve read the application instructions clearly and that you understand what your program requires. Dedman Deadlines Lyle Deadlines Meadows Deadlines Simmons Deadlines Do I apply to the university and to the program? No, you only have to submit one online application through smu.edu/gradapp. When you start your application, you will select the particular program to which you wish to apply. All of your application materials should be uploaded with your application or submitted to the Graduate Application Processing Office. Can I still apply after the deadline? If the posted deadline has passed but you’re still interested in applying, contact your program’s admissions office to see if there may be space available. Sometimes, programs are still willing to review files from promising applicants. I can’t upload items to my application. How can I apply them to my file? Contact the Graduate Application Processing Office directly by emailing your items to gradappmaterials@smu.edu and they can help you upload them to your file. If you have hard copy items that need to be attached to your application (i.e., IELTS test scores, official transcripts, transcript evaluations, etc.), please send them directly to the Graduate Application Processing Office: SMU Graduate Application ProcessingP.O. Box 518Dallas, TX 75275-0518 When will I receive my decision? Dedman: Most departments will not start reviewing applications until after the posted deadline. If your program holds an interview, then they may not make decisions until after they have invited candidates to come to campus. Generally, most departments try to notify students by early to mid-March, but decisions can be received earlier or later than that.

Most programs will have notified their applicants by mid-March with the exception of the final round for Advertising. Is there a deadline for accepting my offer of admission? The general deadline is April 15 for those who receive offers with funding. We ask, however, that you let your program know as soon as possible. Those admitted without funding may be asked to reply by an earlier date, which should be posted in the decision letter. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact your program’s admissions office. Do I apply separately for scholarships?

FAQs | Undergraduate Test-Optional Policy Skip to main content SMU Explore SMU Academics Student Affairs About SMU News Events Calendar Research George W. Bush Presidential Center Current Students Alumni Information for Faculty & Staff Apply to SMUGIVE NOW Undergraduate Admission Apply Visit Financial Aid Menu Search Undergraduate Admission Apply FAQs | Undergraduate Test-Optional Policy FAQs | Undergraduate Test-Optional Policy Apply First Year U.S. Military Veterans International Students Transfer Forms and Applications Readmission Graduate Studies FAQs | Undergraduate Test-Optional Policy Student Resources Submitting Test Scores How long is the test-optional policy in place? SMU is currently fully test-optional. How do I know if I should submit my test scores or not? Admission and scholarship decisions are based on many factors including information from applicants’ high school transcript, personal essay, letters of recommendation, and record of personal achievements in addition to SAT or ACT scores. Under this policy, applicants who choose not to submit ACT or SAT scores will be evaluated on the other factors. Do you superscore standardized test scores? For those who choose to submit scores, SAT and ACT scores are superscored. Self-reported test scores are also accepted. If I choose to self-report test scores, will I be able to report one specific section of the SAT or ACT? For self-reported scores, provide scores for each section of the exam. Partial scores will not be considered. If I submit test scores will I be looked at more favorably than those who do not? No preference is given to applicants who submit or do not submit test scores. Grade/GPA-Related Questions If my grades were impacted by COVID-19, what should I do? All application materials are looked at in context. Many students have seen their academic record impacted by COVID-19, and items will be viewed through that lens. What if my school uses Pass/Fail grades during the Spring 2020 semester? Pass/Fail grades or any other official grading system submitted by your school will be considered in our admission review. If I do not submit test scores, will you put more weight on my GPA? Without test scores, all other elements of your application become more important, including grades, résumé, essays and recommendation letters. Extracurricular Activities My extracurricular activities have been put on hold because of COVID-19, how will they be evaluated during the admission process since many were cancelled? It is understood that most extracurricular activities will be affected in the foreseeable future, and the potential gap in activities will not affect admission to SMU. Cox School of Business If I do not submit test scores, will I be considered for admission to the Cox School of Business? Yes, the Cox School of Business will review all students who list business as an academic interest/major on their application. Scholarship Consideration If I choose not to submit my test scores, will it impact my ability/chances of receiving a merit award? No, academic merit scholarships are awarded to over half of the students in its entering class each fall. They range in value from $20,000 to $30,000 per year and more. These scholarships do not require a separate application and will also follow a test-optional process. If I take the SAT or ACT after I am admitted, can I submit those scores later for scholarship consideration? Yes, additional information for scholarship consideration can be submitted until the scholarship deadline date (typically January 15). If I choose not to submit my scores, how will that impact my ability/chances of receiving departmental scholarships? All students who apply to SMU and list an academic interest or major will be evaluated for departmental scholarships regardless of whether test scores are submitted or not. International Students I am an international student. Are you also waiving English proficiency requirements (e.g. TOEFL, IELTS, etc.)? Proof of English proficiency will still be required if your four years of high school education was not in English. Honors Programs If I do not submit test scores, will I be considered for the University’s honors programs? Yes, without standardized test scores, consideration for the University's honors program will still be given. Future Applicant - Entering SMU in 2023 and Beyond Will SMU consider going to test-optional in future years? At this time, SMU is fully test-optional. If I graduate in 2023 but decide to wait a year to apply to SMU, will this policy still apply to me? If a gap year is desired, apply for admission under the current test-optional policy and, if admitted, request a gap year. How will you review the second semester of my junior year? This is a challenging, uncertain time and SMU will continue to provide a truly holistic review of your application. It is the hope that all applicants will stay actively engaged in their academics to prepare for future academic success as well as for standardized testing. If schools go to a Pass/Fail system of grading (or credit/no credit), how will SMU review this during the application process? Many schools have planned to take this approach. There are no penalties for any adjustment to grading methodology during this period of time.

His senior year, Cole was awarded the “M” Award, the most highly prized recognition bestowed upon students, faculty, staff and administrators on the SMU campus. Cole worked as a middle school choir director in Plano ISD before his interest in student development and college access brought him back to SMU to work in undergraduate admission. Cole earned a Master of Education in Higher Education/Policy and Leadership degree at SMU’s Simmons School of Education and Human Development, where he also served on the Young Leaders in Education board. Cole has continued to sing through church, as an auxiliary chorister with the Dallas Opera, and at community events.

Bush Presidential Center Current Students Alumni Information for Faculty & Staff Apply to SMUGIVE NOW Undergraduate Admission Apply Visit Financial Aid Menu Search Undergraduate Admission Academics FAQs | Academics FAQs | Academics Academics Majors and Minors Schools Faculty Virtual Connections Support and Resources Honors and Scholars Tips SMU Abroad SMU-in-Taos FAQs | Academics When do I register? You may register during orientation, which you complete after you have applied and been admitted to SMU. Orientation is available for both incoming first year students and transfer students. How do I know what classes to take? Upon entering SMU, you will begin fulfilling two general sets of requirements necessary to graduate: the Common Curriculum that all students must satisfy regardless of major, and the requirements specified by the major itself. First-year students are assigned to an academic advisor from Dedman College. Your advisor will work with you regarding selection of classes. When can I see my academic advisor? You are assigned a professional advisor at orientation and are required to connect with him/her before registration each semester. You can also set up appointments on your own time throughout the semester. SMU provides students with a well-staffed, award-winning advising center of professional, full-time advisors. What exactly is a "liberal arts" curriculum? The liberal arts disciplines include the humanities, the natural and the mathematical sciences, and the social sciences. With a foundation in the liberal arts, the SMU student gets a complete education - as a professional in a chosen career, a citizen in the world of ideas, and a full-fledged participant in life itself. SMU's general requirements in the liberal arts (the Common Curriculum) provide students with an exceptional educational opportunity. How and when will I choose a major? SMU offers more than 100 undergraduate majors and 85 minors. Your academic advisor and many other support systems are available to help you choose your major. You will make this decision by the end of your sophomore year. May I declare my major during my first year? Upon entering SMU, you may declare your intended major. All students enter the university through Dedman College of Humanities and Sciences. You may not officially declare your major until you have successfully completed at least 24 hours and satisfied the entrance requirements for your intended major. Does SMU have an honors program? Yes. Students participating in the program will take 7-8 special courses within the University Curriculum which encourage deeper understanding through interdisciplinary thinking and learning. The honors program offers small, discussion-focused classes. Entrance is by invitation. What is the average class size at SMU? The average class size is 22. Seventy percent of our classes contain 25 students or less. Students don't get lost in large lecture courses conducted by graduate students. SMU students learn from senior faculty in small classes. What is the student-to-faculty ratio? 11:1. Classes are small enough to encourage close faculty-student interaction. Will graduate students teach most introductory classes? No. Almost all classes at SMU are taught by faculty, not graduate students. Will I have the opportunity to study abroad? Yes. SMU offers summer, semester and year-long opportunities to live, study and travel in foreign countries. SMU Abroad offers 148 programs in 50 countries. Will SMU send my grades to my parents? The Family Educational Rights to Privacy Act of 1974 states that no personally identifiable information from a student's record will be disclosed to a third party without prior written consent from the student. Grades may be released to parents if either the student completes a release form or the parent completes a Declaration of Dependency form. These releases are available in the Registrar's office. Once SMU has an approved release on file then the parent or student can request an official transcript.

By living in one of the 11 on-campus Residential Commons, SMU students interact with students from across the country and around the world, developing a global perspective right here on campus! All of our Residential Commons -- RC's for short -- are co-ed and offer the same amenities: mostly double-occupancy rooms with similar furnishings and access to classroom and study space and dining options. But, that's where the similarities end. Each architecturally distinctive building houses a community that is ever-evolving with each new group of residents, developing unique traditions, gatherings, and meaningful activities. Each RC even has its own signature crest and colors to further add to the individual identity of the community. Together, the 11 Commons make up a vibrant, dynamic residential living and learning system that reflects the diversity on which SMU thrives as a whole. Explore the Commons here. Faculty Engagement SMU’s commitment to creating lasting, mentoring relationships between students and faculty extends into the Residential Commons system with the Faculty in Residence.

From Move-In Day hustle and bustle and game-day Boulevarding to the Celebration of Lights cheer and Commencement excitement, milestones throughout the year are marked with unforgettable special festivities. From your first Family Weekend to your 50th Homecoming game, you’ll never stop being a Mustang. Motto The SMU motto is veritas liberabit vos, or, “The truth will make you free.” Chosen by SMU’s first president, the motto was adopted in 1912. It’s featured all across campus, including in the official SMU seal cast into the rotunda floor of SMU’s first building, Dallas Hall. Alma Mater Written by an SMU theology student in 1916 and set to words by SMU’s first band director in 1929, “Varsity” has been proudly sung at University events from Opening Convocation to Commencement to sporting events ever since. School Colors SMU’s official school colors are red and blue. Live Mascot SMU’s live mascot, Peruna IX, is a miniature Shetland pony named after an early 20th-century medicine, Peruna Tonic – which was said to have a kick. Mustang fans show school pride with pony ears during school songs, chants and cheers. Learn about the history of the nine Perunas here. Pony Ears We use our “pony ears” hand symbol for pretty much all occasions – when posing for a photo, cheering on the Mustangs or singing our school songs. To make them, start with a peace sign and let your first and middle fingers “relax” so that they’re slightly bent. If you’re singing the fight song, rock your hand back and forth with the music. When you find yourself on campus, bring your pony ears, too! Homecoming Every fall, the Mustang community gathers on the Hilltop to celebrate Homecoming. Students compete through their organizations in a variety of activities to win the day, alumni gather from across the street or around the globe to reconnect at reunion parties, families from surrounding neighborhoods come to watch the Homecoming parade, and all are encouraged to cheer on the ’stangs at Ford Stadium! The Boulevard At SMU, we like to say that we don’t tailgate – we Boulevard. Before home football games, you’ll find students, alumni and Mustang fans socializing up and down Bishop Boulevard. One alumna, Palmer Beldy ’22, shares her top tips for a successful Boulevard. The Hilltop More than a century ago, when our founders set out to find the place to lay the cornerstone of Dallas Hall, they chose the highest point on campus, from where you could look out upon the beautiful city of Dallas toward downtown and the prosperous future that was to come. From there, the nickname "the Hilltop" was born, and it’s the name by which we still refer to our tree-lined, 234-acre campus in the heart of one of the nation’s economic and cultural powerhouses. Events PerunaPalooza | SMU’s springtime festival celebrating Peruna’s birthday. Students enjoy games, rides and activities while helping themselves to a variety of carnival-inspired free food. Pigskin Revue | During Homecoming Weekend, Mustangs take part in our longest running tradition, the Pigskin Revue. Started in 1933, this variety show features acts from groups across the community – students, faculty and alumni. The Mustang Band is heavily featured as participants sing, dance and even take part in some stand-up comedy. Celebration of Lights | SMU and the surrounding communities gather for this joyous occasion to watch the famous Dallas Hall light up with thousands of lights. Guests gather on the Dallas Hall lawn for hot cocoa, cider and warm cookies and to hear holiday carols performed by SMU students. After SMU President R. Gerald Turner reads the Christmas Story, the special evening concludes with the singing of Silent Night and the lighting of SMU’s stunning Dallas Hall and surrounding trees. Tate Lecture Series | The lecture series brings to campus some of the world's most interesting and provocative speakers, including former presidents, commentators, futurists and artistic legends. The Tate Lecture Series annually returns almost $1 million in student scholarships to the University.

The COA is reviewed and approved by the University administration. The following information explains how the COA is determined and the role it plays in calculating your total financial aid package. The Cost of Attendance not only provides baseline information on how much it will cost to attend SMU, but it is also determines the maximum amount a student is eligible to receive in total financial assistance. It is the starting point for building a financial aid award that combines scholarships, grants and loans from various funding sources into a single award package. The combined total of all funding sources cannot exceed the COA. Keep in mind that the COA, as it relates to your financial aid, is the estimated cost for the majority of students enrolled in a degree seeking academic program. It includes allowances for tuition, fees, housing, dining, transportation, books, supplies, and miscellaneous expenses. The amount used for each expense category will vary depending on the degree plan, specific program of study, number of enrolled hours, and choice of housing. Direct Costs vs In-Direct Costs Direct costs: Educational expenses that are billed directly by the University such as tuition, fees, housing and dining for students living on campus. In-Direct costs: Expenses that are directly related to your education, but not billed by the University. For example, students living off campus are expected to pay rent and utilities. These expenses are related to your education, but are not billed directly by the university. They are "in-direct costs". The amounts may vary significantly depending on a student's choice in housing, neighborhood, utility service plans, etc. 2023-2024 Annual Estimated Undergraduate Cost of Attendance The following information is based on enrollment for the fall and spring terms, and registered as a full time student (12-18 credit hours) for each term, Summer and Inter-term expenses are not included in the following example. To determine exact tuition and fees based on 1-11 enrolled hours, please see the University Bursar's Direct Cost of Attendance webpage. Off Campus living expenses are specific to the individual student and should be considered when evaluating your housing options. Expenses will vary significantly due to the choice of neighborhood, apartment rental rates, number of roommates, or living with parents. Graduate and Professional Cost of Attendance The following information is based on estimated expenses for a single student, living off-campus, without a roommate. Information for International Student I-20 Requests can be found here. Direct Costs (Typically billed by SMU): Tuition rates and fees for Graduate programs vary depending on your academic program. To determine exact direct costs for your specific program of study, please see the University Bursar's Direct Cost of Attendance page. Tuition (See Bursar's Direct Cost page )* Student Fees (See Bursar's Direct Cost page )* In-Direct Costs (Estimated expenses not billed by SMU) Allowance for Off-Campus Housing & Dining, Books, Supplies, Loan Fees, Transportation, & Miscellaneous expenses Online programs in-direct cost allowance $27,237 $24,387 **Allowances are estimated based on off-campus housing. Expenses for living off-campus are specific to the individual student and will vary significantly depending on the type of housing, choice in neighborhood, home leasing/rental rates and the number of occupants.

The payment plans allow you to pay your student tuition account charges in monthly installments with no interest charges. Payment plans cannot be applied to Miscellaneous account charges. Payment plans are available for Fall, Spring and Summer Terms. The plans are not available for Jan, May, and August Terms. Re-enrollment in a payment plan is required each term if you choose to participate. An open balance from a previous term cannot be added to a current payment plan. If you enroll in a payment plan for your final term at SMU, your diploma will be held until the payment plan is paid-in-full. However, you will be eligible to participate in the graduation ceremony. A down payment will be required if you enroll in a payment plan close to or after the first installment is due. Fall and Spring Payment Plans Payment plans do not automatically renew. Accordingly, for each term you wish to make monthly payments, you must enroll in a new payment plan. Six Month Payment Plan - This term plan permits payment in 6 installments: July 5 through December 5 for fall and January 5 through June 5 for spring. The non-refundable enrollment fee is $50 per term. The deadline to enroll in this payment plan is August 10 for fall and January 20 for spring.

Multiple payment plans per term are not permitted. The student or Authorized Payer who creates the payment plan will become the “Plan Owner”. Changes to the payment plan can be made by the student, Plan Owner, SMU and Nelnet Campus Commerce. Please note that changes made to the "Payment Method" (bank account or credit card information) can only be made by the Plan Owner. Follow the below instructions for enrollment information: Student Enrollment: Log into your my.SMU account Select the Financials tab from the left-hand menu Select SMUpay from the drop-down menu Select Payment Plan from the SMUpay left-hand menu Authorized Payer Enrollment: In order to enroll in a payment plan, your student must set you up as an Authorized Payer. Click here for instructions on How to Add an Authorized Payer. Once you are set up as an Authorized Payer, go to http://quikpayasp.com/smu/bursar/authorized.do. Enter Login Name and Password Click on Payment Plan in the QuikPay menu How to Make a Payment Toward a Payment Plan Automatic payment is required to enroll into a payment plan. Once payment plan is set up, manual payments should not be made to SMU unless payment plan does not cover SMU Student Account charges. Payments must be made via automatic deduction (ACH) from a regular United States checking or savings account or via credit/debit card (VISA, American Express, Discover and MasterCard). ACH payments are free of charge. Credit/debit card payments will be assessed a non-refundable 2.85% service fee per transaction (charged by Nelnet Campus Commerce). ACH payments are processed on the 5th or 20th of the month, depending on which payment plan you select. When the 5th or 20th falls on a weekend or holiday, ACH payments are processed the following business day. Dates and plan terms may be subject to change without notice. How to Calculate the Amount of your Payment Plan Before your Student Account Balance is Determined You can enroll in a payment plan prior to being fully enrolled by estimating the student account charges and deducting any anticipated financial aid. Once your charges and financial aid are determined, your payment plan can be adjusted by the student, Plan Owner, SMU and Nelnet Campus Commerce (refer to “How to adjust a payment plan” below). Please make sure that your SMU Student Account is fully covered by the SMU payment due date to avoid past due fees of 1.5% per month on any unpaid balance. We created an undergraduate student Cost Estimate Calculator to help you determine the amount of your payment plan total. How to Adjust a Payment Plan A key to a successful payment plan is budgeting correctly. If the payment plan is budgeted incorrectly, your payment plan must be adjusted. In this instance, your payment plan will need to be decreased if the plan exceeds actual costs. If your payment plan does not cover the actual cost, either the plan will need to be increased or a payment will need to be made to SMU for the remaining balance. Changes to the payment plan can be made by the student, Plan Owner, SMU and Nelnet Campus Commerce. If your payment plan does not cover the actual costs, you will need to either increase your payment plan or pay the remaining balance to SMU by the SMU due date.

When can I enroll in a payment plan? April 1 – Enrollment opens for Summer plans June 1 – Enrollment opens for Fall plans November 1 – Enrollment opens for Spring plans 2. May I enroll in a payment plan for prior term or future term charges? Payment plans are term specific and cannot be used to pay prior or future terms. 3. Is it possible to have more than one payment plan per term? Only one payment plan per term, per student, is permitted. 4. What happens if my payment is rejected? If your monthly installment is returned for any reason, Nelnet will notify the Plan Owner and student via email and will reattempt to process the monthly installment from the account provided. The reattempt will occur on or around the 5th of the month for the 5 Month and Summer plans. The reattempt will occur on or around the 20th of the month for the 6 Month plans. If the reattempted payment is returned, your payment plan will automatically terminate without any further notice to you. Upon termination, all unpaid balances will be immediately due and payable to SMU. Furthermore, we reserve the right to refuse your participation in future Nelnet payment plans. If a payment returns, Nelnet Campus Commerce will assess a $30 returned payment fee. 5. What happens if my payment plan defaults? If your payment plan terminates due to two returned payments, you are no longer eligible for future payment plan options. 6. Can I enroll in a payment plan if my balance is not yet determined? Yes, you can enroll in a payment plan, even prior to enrolling in any classes, based on an estimated amount.

To be considered for the Hunt Leadership Scholarship, you also must submit an additional essay as outlined at smu.edu/hunt. Who is eligible for academic scholarships and financial aid? All applicants are considered automatically for academic scholarships. U.S. and dual citizens and permanent residents who submit the FAFSA and CSS PROFILE® are considered for need-based financial aid. The FAFSA will be used to determine federal and state aid eligibility, such as Pell Grant, Federal Direct Loans and Work Study. The CSS PROFILE® will be used to determine eligibility for SMU need based aid. Will I have a financial aid advisor at SMU? SMU assigns a financial aid advisor to each student. When do I apply for financial aid? Simply submit two forms by your chosen application deadline: November 1 for Early Decision I and Early action or January 15 for Early Decision II or Regular Decision.These are priority deadlines. Both forms will be available October 1, 2017. 1. The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for federal and state aid U.S. and dual citizens and permanent residents seeking eligibility for federal and state sources of aid must submit the FAFSA each year. Visit fafsa.gov to file the FAFSA. Use SMU school code 003613. 2. The CSS PROFILE® for institutional aid For SMU opportunity grants, you must submit a CSS PROFILE® financial application each year. This will give our financial aid advisors more information to further assess your financial need. There is a $25 cost for completing the CSS PROFILE®. Visit cssprofile.org to file the CSS PROFILE®. Use SMU school code 6660. How does SMU determine the amount of financial assistance? FAFSA and CSS PROFILE® information is sent to SMU, which compares the cost of attending SMU with the family’s ability to contribute to the cost.

The CSS PROFILE® will be used to determine eligibility for SMU need based aid. When will I receive my award notification? Most academic scholarships are awarded at the time of admission. For need-based awards, SMU must receive and review your FAFSA and CSS PROFILE® before your awards can be determined. What if I receive an off-campus scholarship? Let your financial aid advisor know of any expected scholarships from outside sources. Receipt of off-campus funding might affect your financial aid package by first reducing any need-based loans and/or work-study. How do I accept my financial aid awards?

SMU offers a range of merit and leadership scholarships. These are based on competitive standing within the SMU class and are offered without regard to family financial circumstances. In order to apply, a student should submit his or her application for admission by January 15. There are no additional documents to submit other than the application for admission. However, the Hunt Leadership Scholarship requires a student to submit an additional essay outlined on the admission application. Visit smu.edu/huntapply for more information. What can I expect in the way of a scholarship? Applications that are received by January 15 are automatically considered for merit scholarships. Scholarship committees review all applications and award scholarships to many applicants. We do not publish the qualifications of the different scholarship levels because they are based on the applicant pool every year. The majority of merit scholarship awards are mailed with admission decisions. What types of scholarships does SMU offer? SMU offers academic-based and leadership-based scholarships. These options include, but are not limited to, the following: President's Scholars, Hunt Leadership Scholars, SMU Founders’ Scholars, Second Century Scholars, Cornerstone Scholarships, National Merit Scholarships, Mustang Scholars, Dedman College merit scholarships for first-year students and departmental awards for continuing studies, School of Engineering Honors Scholarship Program, Co-op Education Program, Meadows full and partial scholarships based on artistic merit, Athletic Scholarships, and Mustang Band Scholarships. We do not publish the qualifications of every scholarship level because they are based on the applicant pool each year. More information can be found on the Financial Aid website. Are there special scholarships for Methodist students? Methodist applicants receive the same consideration as all other students for SMU financial aid programs. They also can receive consideration for specifically dedicated programs. These include: The Methodist Student Loan Fund, Minister's Family Tuition Awards ($3,500/term), and United Methodist Scholarships (vary in amount). What kind of financial aid is available? A student who demonstrates financial need is awarded an aid "package" that combines SMU funds with governmental sources. Grants, low-cost loans, and part-time work opportunities typically appear in need-based packages. Middle- or upper-level income families who may not meet federal need standards can apply for family loan programs and extended payment plans. See the Financial Aid website for more information on Student Loans and Federal Work Study (Student Employment). Do I apply for financial aid before or after I apply for admission? File the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) as close to February 15 as possible for federal need-based aid consideration. The FAFSA application is available online at studentaid.gov. You also need to file the College Scholarship Service CSS Profile™ to further assess your financial need for need-based programs. This form can be found at student.collegeboard.org/profile. There is a $25 fee to file the CSS Profile™. After I file the FAFSA and CSS Profile™, how will I know if SMU has received my information? The federal processor will email you the Student Aid Report (SAR) on FAFSA information. If you listed SMU on your FAFSA and CSS Profile™, SMU will receive your information electronically. What kind of financial aid will I receive because I filed the FAFSA and CSS Profile™? You will be considered for all federal, state (Texas residents only), and SMU need-based funding. These programs are awarded on the basis of documented financial need and funding availability. When will I receive my financial aid award letter notification? Generally, award letters are mailed beginning March 15. SMU must receive and review your electronic FAFSA and CSS Profile™before mailing an award letter. What do I do after I receive my financial aid award letter? The award letter packet provides details regarding financial aid, as well as instructions on how to respond to SMU's offer. Please read and review the information and instructions carefully. If you have questions, contact your SMU financial aid advisor. How does SMU determine the amount of financial assistance? FAFSA and CSS Profile™information are sent to SMU, which compares the cost of attending SMU with the amount of money a family is estimated to still need after all state, federal, and scholarship money is factored in. Financial aid advisors begin packaging financial aid in March, starting with students who applied early. What are my chances of receiving financial aid? You need to apply to SMU and file a FAFSA and CSS Profile™to help the University determine eligibility for financial aid. We have no way of knowing your chances until you apply. SMU has many financial aid avenues, including options for middle-income families. What is the difference between grants and loans? Grants are gift aid and do not have to be repaid. Loans must be repaid. How will I receive the financial aid funds that are awarded? Before each term begins, the scholarships and grants are applied to your student account. If you have applied for and completed necessary loan processing, those funds will be applied each term to your student account when received from the lender. What should I do if I have a special financial circumstance (such as the loss of a job) since I filed my FAFSA and CSS Profile™? Contact your financial aid advisor to discuss any special or unusual circumstances. Are on-campus jobs available, and how do I get paid for working?

You will be considered automatically for these scholarships when you apply for admission. SMU has specific scholarships available for National Merit Scholars, International Baccalaureate Diploma candidates and many other scholarships for our top applicants. Additionally, Dedman College, Cox School of Business, Lyle School of Engineering, Meadows School of the Arts and Simmons School of Education and Human Development offer scholarships to selected students who express an interest in a major in those schools. The President’s Scholars Program President’s Scholarships are awarded to students who have shown exemplary academic skills, and is SMU's most prestigious merit-based scholarship. The award is full tuition and fees plus study abroad. Students who live on campus also receive a scholarship for room and board. For consideration, students must have exceptional achievement on the SAT or ACT and in their high school curriculum. The Nancy Ann and Ray L. Hunt Leadership Scholars Program Hunt Leadership Scholarships are awarded to students with extraordinary leadership qualities and strong academic performance. Students selected as Hunt Leadership Scholars for the Class of 2026 will receive an annual Hunt Scholarship of $46,000, or a total of $184,000 over four years. The award also includes airfare and tuition costs for any courses during an international, leadership-based experience immediately following each scholar's sophomore year. An additional essay is required. Click here to complete the online Hunt Leadership Scholars Application. Provost Scholarship, SMU Distinguished Scholarship, Second Century Scholarship, University Scholarship The Provost Scholarship, SMU Distinguished Scholarship, Second Century Scholarship and the University Scholarship are awarded to those students who have demonstrated outstanding academic success throughout high school – most importantly by presenting a combination of high school grades and standardized test scores that together place them among the top students applying to SMU each year. Students selected as a Provost, SMU Distinguished, Second Century or University Scholar are recognized as potential leaders in the classroom at SMU. This designation is based on information submitted in the application for admission and may be updated by sending additional SAT or ACT scores directly from The College Board or ACT, Inc. respectively. These scholarship offers are typically included in a student’s admission packet. International Baccalaureate (IB) Scholars Students who complete the IB Diploma Program will receive a $7,500 per academic year scholarship. This scholarship may be combined with other scholarship or grant aid from SMU, but in no case can the combination of institutional aid exceed Tuition and Fees for that academic year. Learn more about academic scholarships. Need-based Assistance Learn more about the financial aid process at SMU. Your financial situation is unique, so we offer a variety of options to meet your needs. These include SMU Opportunity Awards as well as state and federal sources of financial assistance, depending on financial need and residency. An undergraduate’s average need-based loan amount is $4,640 annually. Start Your Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) For U.S. and dual citizens and permanent residents to be eligible for federal and state sources of aid, the first step is to submit the FAFSA. You must complete a FAFSA each year for continued consideration for state and federal financial aid. List SMU as your school of choice on the FAFSA. SMU’s school code is 003613. Submit your FAFSA by January 15 for priority consideration for need-based awards. Start Your College Scholarship Service CSS Profile™ For SMU-funded aid, you also must submit a CSS Profile™ financial aid application to the College Board. This application will give our financial aid advisors more information to further determine your eligibility for university need-based aid. List SMU as your school of choice on the CSS Profile™, and use the code 6660. There is a $25 cost for completing the CSS Profile™. Submit your CSS Profile™ by January 15 for priority consideration for need-based awards. Dallas County Promise Scholarship The Promise Scholarship is awarded in partnership with the Dallas County Promise program to provide a college education to students graduating from eligible high schools in Dallas County. The SMU partnership specifically seeks to identify future leaders of Dallas County and provide them an opportunity to earn an SMU degree. SMU will select up to five (5) high school seniors to receive a two-year Promise Scholarship. This is a last-dollar scholarship (combined with other grants and scholarships) to provide full tuition and fees. Learn the full eligibility requirements and conditions here. Grants and loans Grants and loans that may be a part of your SMU financial package include: Federal Pell Grant Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG) TEXAS Tuition Equalization Grant (TEG) Federal Subsidized Stafford Loan Federal Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS) Federal Unsubsidized Stafford Loan SMU Need-Based Grant Off-campus scholarships If an adjustment to a need-based financial aid package is necessary, the outside scholarship will be used first to replace a student's earnings expectation, Federal Work Study and Subsidized Stafford loans before reducing SMU need-based assistance. All outside scholarships will be split 50/50 between fall and spring semester unless otherwise instructed by the donor/foundation. If you are receiving some form of outside scholarship, download the Outside Scholarship Form (PDF) and submit it to the Office of Financial Aid & Scholarships.

Students can enter their test scores on The Common Application and on the MyCoalition Application on the testing page of the application. On the ApplyTexas application, students will not be prompted to enter test scores. Once the application is submitted, students will be able to self-report scores using the form on the personalized application status page. If you have submitted an application and would like to submit new self-reported test scores, please do so via your personalized application status page. If you have questions about self-reported standardized test scores, please contact your admission counselor. Find and connect with yours at www.smu.edu/counselor.

Bush Presidential Center Current Students Alumni Information for Faculty & Staff Apply to SMUGIVE NOW Undergraduate Admission Apply Visit Financial Aid Menu Search Apply Transfer FAQs FAQs Transfer Benefits of an SMU Education Transfer Scholarships Transfer Admission Application Process Transfer Dates and Deadlines Transfer Pathway Guides Transfer Equivalency Tool Meadows Auditions and Portfolios Transfer Forms and Applications International Transfer Students FAQs Congratulations on your admission to SMU! How Credits Transfer Partnership Programs What are the minimum requirements for transferring to SMU? SMU’s Office of Undergraduate Admission separates transfer students into two categories, transfer and first-year transfer, based on the number of transferrable hours completed at the time of application. For full details on transfer requirements, visit our Transfer Admission page. What is the maximum number of units that can transfer? A minimum of 60 credit hours must be completed at SMU to earn your degree. However, if you have more than 62 transferable hours, they will all “transfer” and be used in the admissions, scholarship and financial aid process. You and your SMU academic advisor will determine which hours will apply to your degree. Which courses transfer to SMU? Each academic department determines which courses will transfer. Based on your credit transfer evaluation and several other factors, the Admission Office determines your admissibility. Generally, if SMU has a comparable course (equal in content and level), you are likely to receive credit for the course. If you attend Dallas County Community College, Tarrant County College, or Collin College, transferability can be easily determined because we have equivalency guides for those colleges. Is transfer credit given for correspondence courses? No. Who determines which courses will transfer? The individual academic departments for each school determine course transferability. Do I need to submit my high school transcript? Yes, we use the high school transcript for several reasons: 1) to verify math readiness (algebra I, geometry, algebra II) when the college transcript does not show college algebra or higher, 2) to determine admissibility of a transfer student who has less than 30 transferable hours and 3) to register and to verify two years of the same foreign language. How is my transferable GPA calculated? Your transferable GPA is determined by including all courses that are considered comparable to SMU courses from every college attended. The number of grade points earned is divided by the number of attempted hours. If you receive a D or F in a comparable course, the D or F will be used in the calculation of your GPA, but you will not actually be awarded transfer credit for that course, since SMU does not award credit for grades lower than C-. If you receive a D or F in a course that is not comparable, then it will not be counted in the GPA. What kinds of scholarship opportunities are available for transfer students? Full tuition opportunities exist for students from Dallas, Collin, Tarrant, Grayson, Kaufman and Navarro County Community College Districts with 50 transferable hours and a 3.70 GPA. Half tuition opportunities also exist for transfer students coming from any college or university with 50 transferable hours and a 3.70 GPA. For more information, visit Transfer Scholarships. First-year transfers with a competitive high school profile and less than 30 transferable hours may be eligible for First-Year Scholarships. On what should I write my essay, and how long should it be? While an essay is not required for transfer admission, it is strongly encouraged. The essay provides a chance to move beyond the numbers and statistics. It's your chance to set yourself apart from all the other applicants. A thoughtful, well-written essay can positively influence the admission committee's final decision and is a critical element in the selection of winners for competitive scholarships. The essay topic and length will be determined by the application method (The Common Application, ApplyTexas, SMU Transfer Application) you choose. All essays will be reviewed equally, regardless of application type. Do foreign transcripts require additional documentation? Yes. Any student who submits a foreign transcript is responsible for submitting the additional documentation required for evaluation. Keep in mind that for SMU to convert the courses to US credits, we need very specific information about the term calendar year, grading scale, course descriptions, length of class, etc. To understand more about the documentation required, see Transfer Credit Policies for International Students. What kinds of resources are available to U.S. Veterans transferring to SMU? Veterans must meet general admission requirements for transfer. For information on benefits and financial assistance, see our Veterans Affairs page. Do I have to reapply if I have previously applied? You do not have to fill out another application, but you do need to complete a Transfer Update Form. How do I seek readmission to the University? If you were previously enrolled at SMU, but have not been enrolled for two or more regular terms (regular terms are fall and spring), or if you have been suspended, then you must be readmitted to SMU. To begin the readmission process, you must complete the Readmission Application (PDF).

When borrowing money for living expenses, many students find that they can live on less than the estimated amounts below. A student may also borrow to pay tuition costs not covered by scholarships. This means that a student with no scholarship could borrow the full tuition amount below, while a scholarship recipient could borrow an amount equal to the full amount below minus the scholarship amount. Non-tuition allowances for variable expenses Housing/Meals $19,630 This amount is based on rent and meal expenses of $2,043 per month. There are a large number of apartments within just a few miles of campus, with rent amounts that vary greatly, so your cost could be less. Additionally, renting a studio apartment or sharing a multi-bedroom apartment will typically be much less. Personal/misc. $4,000 Transportation $2,232 $248 per month. This cost could be less if you take advantage of the student Dallas Area Rapid Transit pass or use the campus shuttle that stops at nearby apartment complexes. Books and supplies $2,000 Buy used books to reduce costs. Loan fees $1,270 This expense only applies to students who borrow funds.This item will be $0 for non-borrowers. Total non-tuition allowances $29,132 As a practical matter, students' living expenses will differ based on personal choices and circumstances.A student may borrow any amount up to the amount at left, but can reduce costs by making cost-conscious choices. Tuition $56,254 Scholarships are credited to student accounts. General Fees $7,248 Total allowances - the maximum amount a loan-eligible student with no scholarship may borrow. $92,634 This is the maximum amount a loan-eligible student with no scholarship may borrow.

Applications completed by the regular decision deadline will automatically be considered for academic scholarships. Scholarships for full-time students typically are awarded on the basis of an outstanding undergraduate record and a strong performance on the LSAT.

APPLICATION in PDF format LSAC ELECTRONIC APPLICATION Personal statement Résumé Two letters of recommendation Certified undergraduate and law school transcripts. Transcripts must be mailed directly to the Admissions Office from your schools. International Applicants International applicants for whom English is not the primary language must take the TEST OF ENGLISH AS A FOREIGN LANGUAGE (TOEFL) or International English Language Testing System (IELTS). Information is available regarding the two tests from www.ets.org or www.IELTS.org. SMU's institution code for the TOEFL is 6660, department code 03. There is no institution code for the IELTS. The TOEFL or IELTS score must be reported to SMU directly. Application Deadline Applications for LL.M. programs are processed on a continuous basis beginning in early December. It is in your best interest to submit your application as early as possible. Applications must be postmarked by April 1. All supporting documentation must be received by April 15. Late applications will be accepted on a space-available basis. Applications will be reviewed upon completion, and decisions will be made shortly thereafter. Bar Exam Eligibility International students who wish to practice law in this country and qualify for admission to the bar in one of the states or the District of Columbia should familiarize themselves with the bar admission requirements in the particular jurisdiction where they plan to practice. Bar admission requirements vary from state to state. Some states require applicants to have a J.D. degree, and others will require only a certain number of course credits from a law school in this country. Texas now allows qualified foreign educated attorneys who have completed an LL.M. degree to sit for the Texas Bar examination. For complete rules governing Admission to the State Bar of Texas CLICK HERE. For information regarding the Eligibility of Foreign-Educated Applicants and Foreign Attorneys to take the Texas Bar Examination CLICK HERE. Application to the J.D. Program The J.D. is the basic law degree for U.S. law students. For this reason, the School of Law does not normally consider the degree appropriate for international students already possessing basic law degrees within their home countries. However, in a limited number of instances, international students who have graduated with distinction in the LL.M. program of the Dedman School of Law and who can demonstrate legitimate graduate study objectives for furthering their careers in their home countries may be considered for admission to the J.D. program. These students are not required to take the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT). Admission under such conditions will normally entail an additional study of 72-87 credit hours. Advanced credit, if any, is based upon the student’s foreign law study, not on the LL.M. credit.

Abigail Grieve, Class of 2022 - SMU Dedman School of Law Skip to main content SMU Explore SMU Academics Undergraduate Admission Student Affairs About SMU News Athletics Events Calendar George W. Bush Presidential Center Prospective Students Current Students Alumni Information for Faculty & Staff Apply to SMUGIVE NOW Dedman School of Law Menu Search Admissions Student Profiles Abigail Grieve, Class of 2022 Abigail Grieve, Class of 2022 1. Tell us about yourself. My name is Abigail Grieve, and I am a 3L at SMU Dedman School of Law. I am from New Braunfels, Texas, and attended Texas Christian University for undergrad, where I graduated in 2019 with a B.S. in Psychology and minors in political science and criminal justice. I enjoy reading novels and collecting books, TCU football (go frogs!), baking and trying new restaurants (mostly sushi), and I have two cats named Georgia and Friday. 2. Why did you decide to come to SMU Law? I think I have a very typical story of being a stubborn little kid with my parents telling me that I could argue with a rock and should be a lawyer when I grow up; as such law school has been a consideration of mine since around 7th grade. However, when I started at TCU, I was a neuroscience major on the pre-med track and thought that I wanted to attend medical school and maybe become a clinical psychologist—organic chemistry quickly changed my mind on that. Having already started my minors in criminal justice and political science, I knew that those courses were a much better fit for me and made the change to pre-law. I really loved the idea of being a professional problem solver and learning all the nitty-gritty aspects of the law while still being able to be creative in developing a solution towards the best outcome for a client. When choosing to come to SMU, I have grown up in Texas and lived in Fort Worth during undergrad, so staying in Texas was always a consideration; SMU felt home in the way TCU did and I was very excited to move to Dallas. 3. What has been your favorite class and why? I absolutely loved Contracts I and II with Professor Rogers. I really enjoyed the topic and the process of considering the various aspects of making, breaking, and terminating a contract from a legal perspective. But really, after spending a year with my section and Professor Rogers, the class was just fun. 4. When you are not in school or studying, what do you do for fun? I really enjoy reading thriller/mystery and fantasy novels and have since I was a young. As I got older, my love of books has also grown into cultivating my personal library and book-collecting, as I currently own about 900 books. A goal of mine is to have a library room in my home someday. 5. What extracurricular activities have you enjoyed most and why? (SBA, moot court, etc.). I currently serve as President of Family Law Association, where I have been a member since 1L and served on the Exec Board last year. Family law isn’t a very common interest at SMU, and I really enjoy getting to be part of an organization of students passionate about the practice area. I am looking forward to this year and holding more events and networking with family law practitioners in DFW. I am also an Articles Editor for SMU Law Review Association, and last year I wrote my comment on a family law topic. I really enjoyed getting to spend many months diving deep into one topic and getting to write about something I was passionate about. 6. How has law school challenged you most? The most challenging part of my law school experience has honestly been being at home this past year and a half with the COVID-19 restrictions. Having to completely change course to online school was difficult for me as I really need a different environment for learning as compared to my home where I relax, and I think re-wiring my thinking to doing both in one space took some adjusting. It was strange to be at my kitchen table for hours on end in class; I got distracted easier and found myself looking at my phone or going to make a snack or thinking about what needed to be tidied up in my house. It was a learning experience for me, and I definitely know that being in a classroom or workplace and interacting with other people every day is where I thrive. I am very happy to be back on campus this year! 7. What has been your most memorable law school moment so far? My most memorable moment of law school so far was getting the call that I had written-on to SMU Law Review. We waited about a month-and-a-half between completing the write-on competition and finding out if we made a law review, and it was nerve-wracking. It was a brand-new skill, and I had no idea if I was any good at it since write-on was the first time I had completed an editing process like that, and I spent the entire summer telling myself that it was okay if I didn’t write-on to any of the law reviews. So, when I picked up the phone the night calls went out and was congratulated on making SMU Law Review, I was shocked and excited, and know I will always remember every detail of that moment. 8. What do you plan to do post-graduation? I am very interested in practicing family law after graduation, and am specifically interested in complex asset division and the ways that different areas of the law such as business and tax law affect marital division of assets and debts. 9. Have you had any important mentors during law school? If so, who? Professor Leatherberry has been a mentor to me over this past year as she advised me throughout my law review comment writing process and provided great insight and advice as to the job search process both for summers and post-grad. I am very grateful to have found a professor who I can connect with!

Bush Presidential Center Prospective Students Current Students Alumni Information for Faculty & Staff Apply to SMUGIVE NOW Dedman School of Law Menu Search Admissions Student Profiles Alicia Iwema, Class of 2022 Alicia Iwema, Class of 2022 1. Tell us about yourself. I grew up in New Jersey, in a textbook blue-collar, Jersey-Italian family. I attended college in New York state, where I studied vocal performance, linguistics, Spanish, French, and intercultural studies. I moved to Texas in 2014 to pursue an MA in applied linguistics. While in Dallas, I met my now-husband, and eleven weeks ago, he and I welcomed our first two children into the world! 2. Why did you decide to come to SMU Law? When I decided to apply to law school, I had no idea that SMU Law existed. I had strong ties to Dallas because I was really involved in my church community and was dating my now-husband and singing semi-professionally. I didn’t want to leave, but I also wanted to attend a law school with a reputation for academic excellence in both transactional and litigation work. When I discovered that SMU Law would provide me with an excellent legal education while allowing me to stay near my community, I didn’t want to go anywhere else. 3. What has been your favorite class and why? I absolutely loved taking Evidence with Prof. Hillel Bavli (although Principles of Antitrust with Prof. Paul Rogers and Advanced Contracts Drafting Workshop with Prof. Glen West are close runners-up). The course seemed to rest at the intersection of law, linguistics, and psychology, and I found that fascinating; it was satisfying to participate in a course that simultaneously challenged both my intuitive side and my analytical side. I also appreciated Prof. Bavli’s teaching style. 4. When you are not in school or studying, what do you do for fun? I love spending quality time with my family and friends, studying the Bible, singing, traveling, learning languages, and playing in the ocean. 5. What extracurricular activities have you enjoyed most and why? (ROTC, SBA, moot court, etc.) I really enjoyed serving as a Lead Articles Editor on the SMU Law Review. The position exposed me to tons of interesting legal scholarship, and I enjoyed learning to distinguish well-crafted arguments from faulty arguments and effective writing from weak writing. I also liked thinking strategically about which articles our journal should accept. 6. How has law school challenged you most? Law school has forced me to learn how to prioritize my time and effort. I’ve had to work to find the appropriate balance between career and family, and I’ve also had to learn to structure my time well when I’m working so that I’m giving the appropriate degree of attention to each task. 7. What has been your most memorable law school moment so far? I’ll never forget the time I emailed one of my professors asking for advice and he called me on a Friday night, talked through the problem with me for about an hour, then put far more energy into solving it than I anticipated, even though he was extremely busy at the time. 8. What do you plan to do post-graduation? I’ve accepted clerkships with Hon. Thomas Barber on the District Court for the Middle District of Florida and Hon. Cory Wilson on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. I’ve also accepted a position in Weil, Gotshal & Manges’s Dallas office. 9. Have you had any important mentors during law school? If so, who? I’ve benefited from exceptional mentorship throughout my time at SMU. I don’t know where I’d be right now without the encouragement and guidance I’ve received from professors like Paul Rogers, Julie Rogers, Natalie Nanasi, Jeffrey Kahn, Heather Stobaugh, and, especially, Hillel Bavli. 10. Where do you see yourself in 5 and 10 years? This question is difficult to answer, because everything about my trajectory has surprised me so far—the classes I’ve liked, the clerkships I’ve been offered, the fact that I plan to work in a large firm. I imagine that in five years, I’ll be acquiring specialized expertise in bankruptcy, appellate briefing, or evidentiary issues, and I’ll be starting to adopt leadership roles at my firm in Dallas. In ten years, I may be trying to make partner. I think I’d eventually like to be a judge, though.

Bush Presidential Center Prospective Students Current Students Alumni Information for Faculty & Staff Apply to SMUGIVE NOW Dedman School of Law Menu Search Admissions Student Profiles Amber Ward Amber Ward, Class of 2022 1. Tell us about yourself. I am a 2L at SMU Law. I was born and raised in Dallas, TX and I received my undergraduate degree in Political Science from the illustrious, Howard University. On campus, I am involved with the Board of Advocates, Christian Legal Society, and the Black Law Students Association. I also work in the Admission’s Office and I am a Barbri Ambassador. Off campus, I volunteer in a mentorship program with the Dallas Champions Academy. 2. Why did you decide to come to SMU Law?I came to SMU Law largely because of the Minority Pre-Law Symposium that is held every year. By attending the symposium, I was able to gain an appreciation for SMU Law’s commitment to diversity, which is important to me as a Black student. I considered that attending SMU would allow me to come home after four years in DC and get a footing in the Dallas legal market where I intend to practice. 3. What has been your favorite class and why? My favorite class so far has been Criminal Plea Negotiations because it was the first class that I felt gave me practical experience. In the class, I was able to practice plea negotiations with my classmates which gave me great exposure to what that process may be like in the real world. Through this class, I was also able to meet attorneys and judges in the area who gave us great advice and were awesome examples of criminal legal professionals. 4. When you are not in school or studying, what do you do for fun? When I have time, which is rare these days, I love to bake for my friends and family. I like to bake anything from cookies to cheesecakes to pies. I also enjoy spending as much quality time as I can with my family, including my mom, little brother, and grandparents. 5. What extracurricular activities have you enjoyed most and why? (SBA, moot court, etc.) I’ve most enjoyed being on my mock trial team. On the team, I get to work students and my coaches, Chris Klement and Gracen Daniel, who push me as an advocate. I am able to learn practical litigation skills and apply those skills in practice and competition. It’s also a lot of fun! 6. How has law school challenged you most? Law school has definitely challenged my study habits. I’ve had to learn the best ways for me to study through a lot of trial and error because I quickly learned that what worked for me in undergrad would not translate to law school. Law school has also challenged me to give myself much more grace than I had in the past. Law school is undeniably hard, so some of my former perfectionist ways had to be replaced with a lot of grace and understanding for myself. I’ve become much kinder to myself since starting law school. 7. What has been your most memorable law school moment so far? I can’t pin down one specific moment, but the most memorable overall experience that I have had is making some lifelong friends. I did not expect to come to law school and meet true friends, but I am blessed to be able to say that I did. A few of my 1L section mates became some of my best friends, so spending everyday with them our 1L year is probably my most memorable experience so far. 8. What do you plan to do post-graduation? After graduation (and passing the bar), I hope to be gainfully employed doing some sort of public interest work or working in criminal litigation. Honestly, I am still figuring out exactly what my life will look like post-grad. 9. Have you had any important mentors during law school? If so, who? I have had many mentors through law school and they’ve all been amazing! Ben West is a mentor that I met through the Leadership Counsel on Legal Diversity program and he has been awesome! I’ve also had many student/peer mentors who have helped me along the way like Briana August (SMU ’20), Haley Caradonna, Claire Fialcowitz, Danielle Allo, Autumn Keefer, (all current 3Ls), and many more! I truly believe in the value of mentorship and I am so grateful to all of my mentors, including ones that I did not mention by name. 10. Where do you see yourself in 5 and 10 years? In 5 years, I see myself settled in the practice area of my choice (still deciding) and still living in Dallas. Within 10 years, I will probably run for public office. I may be Congresswoman Ward by then. Maybe I’ll have started my own little family by then as well, but we’ll just have to see where God takes me on that one.

Bush Presidential Center Prospective Students Current Students Alumni Information for Faculty & Staff Apply to SMUGIVE NOW Dedman School of Law Menu Search Admissions Student Profiles Bach Norwood Bach Norwood, Class of 2022 1. Tell us about yourself. I’m a 39 year-old professional musician, presently pivoting to a career in law. I grew up in Northern Louisiana. For context, my hometown was the location for the filming of the reality television show “Duck Dynasty.” It’s a long drive from New Orleans, but I’m still very proud of my gumbo recipes. I moved to Dallas in 2002 to pursue my bachelor’s degree in Jazz Studies at the University of North Texas. I play the double bass & piano in various jazz, bluegrass, rock, and classical ensembles, and have been performing all over the world as a full-time freelance musician for over a decade—to date, I’ve been to over two dozen countries across the Americas, Europe, Asia, and Australia. Prior to being accepted to study law at SMU, one of my most interesting roles was Musical Director and pianist for The Polyphonic Spree, an internationally-acclaimed rock band. In 2016, we were honored to take part in an all-star tribute to David Bowie at Radio City Music Hall in New York. I’m also a founding member of Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Bluegrass Band. You can catch us most years performing on the Main Stage at the Texas State Fair. 2. Why did you decide to come to SMU Law? I got married last year. Finding the person I wanted to spend my life with has also made me grow up a little—it’s not just about me anymore. While my musical career has been exciting and fulfilling, it has been anything but stable over the years. For freelancers, the economic cycles of “feast and famine” perpetuate a scarcity-based pattern of life decisions that are often not conducive to building a secure foundation upon which to start a family. I have enjoyed a happy life using my musical talents in service to others. But in coming to law school, I want to develop my other latent abilities (while keeping a service-oriented focus) in the hopes of creating a financially secure future for my family. My decision to attend SMU was greatly influenced by my interactions with SMU alumni. I have had the privilege of working with many talented individuals, but among my many colleagues, the SMU alumni stand out. Several of my mentors are alumni of the SMU Dedman School of Law. Whether graduates of law, business, music, or divinity, SMU alumni are all distinguished by the caliber of their work and the integrity of their character. It is my desire to one day count myself among them and contribute my own passion, creativity, and excellence to the SMU legacy. Additionally (and practically), the prospect of living and working in the city of Dallas was a major factor in deciding to apply here. In all my travels, I have yet to discover a better “total-package economy.” With its affordable cost of living, high wages, and ease of travel, this city is hard to beat. 3. What has been your favorite class and why? I admit I may be experiencing “present-bias,” but I feel particularly lucky to find myself immersed in an area of law in which I intend to practice: bankruptcy. I am concurrently enrolled in Creditor’s Rights, and participating in a Federal Judicial Externship in the Northern District of Texas Bankruptcy Court. I see bankruptcy law as an attractive avenue of service, and I am thoroughly invested and engaged in becoming conversant in its many complexities. 4. When you are not in school or studying, what do you do for fun? These days, self-care is paramount. I try to engage in enjoyable activities that support my physical and mental health, as well as feed my soul. I maintain a yoga practice, go for runs a few times a week, and take part in Sunday morning worship at Saint Michael and All Angels Episcopal Church. It has been my cherished privilege, especially during the pandemic, to regularly inhabit this inspired space at the intersection of music and spirit. 5. What extracurricular activities have you enjoyed most and why? (SBA, moot court, etc.) This summer, I took part in the SMU COVID-19 Legal Helpline, in conjunction with the Association for Public Interest Law, the SMU Legal Clinics, and a host of community partners. My role began as an operator/interviewer, fielding calls and working with attorney supervisors to provide the North Texas area with much-needed legal help. My role evolved into a junior leadership position, and I continue to provide support to the Helpline. It has been an incredible learning experience which has developed my lawyering skills, while providing me with an opportunity to offer meaningful help to real people with real problems. 6. How has law school challenged you most? Harkening back to my freelance days, I thought I knew time management. But it turns out, I was just busy going from deadline to deadline. I got plenty of work done, but it was often “one-offs,” sprinting from gig to gig. Now that I’m in law school, I have long expanses of time upon which I must impose structure. And without effective time management techniques, responsibilities snowball, leading to stress. Especially in my first semester, I lost a lot of sleep (and missed out on quality time with loved ones) because of this. 7. What has been your most memorable law school moment so far? I have performed on countless stages in front of thousands of people, and thought I had long banished any vestige of stage fright—that was, until my first cold-call in Professor Rogers’ 1L Contracts class. It wasn’t until I opened my mouth to answer his question that I realized how nervous I was! Maybe it was the fact that I was surrounded by brilliant minds, dissecting my every word. Or maybe it was because I had watched “The Paper Chase” the night before. Anyway, looking back, I am grateful for that nervous feeling. It was a mile marker on a journey of growth which has led me to a new level of confidence in public speaking. 8. What do you plan to do post-graduation? I aspire to serve as a Term Clerk in the bankruptcy court after graduation. From my vantage point, I have observed the important work clerks do, and the excellent training they receive. By all accounts, this training is also a powerful career springboard. 9. Have you had any important mentors during law school? If so, who? I have had the benefit of a few mentorships before and during law school. Interestingly, two of my attorney-mentors are musicians as well! Alan Tompkins (Vice President, General Counsel, & Trustee - Unity Hunt / Hunt Capital Group / Hunt Sports Group) & Robert Hough (IP & Advertising Attorney at Sheppard Mullin Richter & Hampton LLP). They gave me so much time, attention, and advice (and never let me pick up the check!). I hope to pay their generosity forward someday. 10. Where do you see yourself in 5 and 10 years? This summer, I worked at a small bankruptcy firm, primarily under the direction of an attorney who was in his fifth year of practice. The ingenuity and creativity of his advocacy was truly inspiring. And more than that, he just seemed happy. In five years, I want feel like I am making strides towards a similar practice, while still having time to be present for my growing family. In ten years? I only wish for more of the same: I want to carve out and master my skill set, providing valuable services to my clients, and doing so with no regrets.

Bush Presidential Center Prospective Students Current Students Alumni Information for Faculty & Staff Apply to SMUGIVE NOW Dedman School of Law Menu Search Admissions Student Profiles Brent Miles Brent Miles 1. Tell us about yourself. I was born in Houston, Texas. I have three siblings & three nieces, and I love them all to death. I enjoy playing rugby and discovering new music. 2. Why did you decide to come to SMU Law? I was initially going to be a petroleum engineer! I went to Texas Tech to study that, but somewhere along the path I fell out of love with the idea of engineering and gravitated toward law school. I did my applications and SMU was the first school to reach out to me with my acceptance. Once I got my acceptance from SMU, I knew that it was the place for me. 3. What has been your favorite class and why? My favorite class is insurance with Ernest Martin. I clerked for an insurance defense and coverage firm this summer and really enjoyed the work I did there, so when I got to class I felt like I really understood what he was talking about and was able to participate at a high level. For me, that practical knowledge from the summer made all the difference in my classroom experience. 4. When you are not in school or studying, what do you do for fun? These days I really like to spend time hanging out with my girlfriend and my friends. I’ve been playing a lot of golf, trying out new restaurants around Dallas, and trying to make as many memories as possible. With this being the last year of school for me, those things became really important. 5. What extracurricular activities have you enjoyed most and why? (SBA, moot court, etc.) I’ve enjoyed my time on the SBA the most. Being the President of the SBA is something I am really proud of, and I have a lot of fun meeting new students and watching friends come together at the various events that we put on. 6. How has law school challenged you most? Law school has challenged me in more ways than I ever thought possible. I think the biggest challenge I’ve had is fighting my own expectations. Coming into law school I honestly thought I’d be valedictorian, Order of the Barrister’s, etc. When I didn’t get the marks I needed to achieve those expectations, I had to find the peace to be ok with myself, while also forging a new path in school that I would also be proud of. 7. What has been your most memorable law school moment so far? My most memorable moment is definitely when my Arbitration team beat Texas Tech in the preliminary round to help advance our team to nationals. In the Arbitration space, Texas Tech is kind of our rivals because they always advance to nationals and we wanted to beat them badly last year. When my partner, Hunter Ralston, and I came out victorious it was the best feeling ever. 8. What do you plan to do post-graduation? I plan on studying hard for the bar exam, taking a nice vacation with my family, and then settling into work. I’m excited about the future. 9. Have you had any important mentors during law school? If so, who? My most influential mentor has been Dennis Duffy. He is a labor & employment lawyer in Houston. He is the kind of mentor that I always looked up to growing up from a young age, and although he might not know this, I looked as his life as the kind of life I wanted to have for my family and I one day. Since being at SMU I’ve tried to approach everyone as someone I can learn something from, and that’s been really invaluable in my development as a future attorney. I feel lucky to have folks in my life willing to share their wisdom and advice with me. 10. Where do you see yourself in 5 and 10 years? My long-term orientation is focused on my mental health and my family, so in 5 years and in 10 years I just hope my loved ones are still healthy, happy, and safe. I hope that my career builds on itself and I continue to challenge myself in whatever I’m doing, but my biggest hope for the future is that my loved ones are doing well and everyone is cared for.

Tell us about yourself. I am a 1L student. I am from Tyler, Texas, and I am a first generation college student. 2. Why did you decide to come to SMU Law? I decided to come to SMU Law primarily because I desire to work and start a family in the DFW area, as well as I spent a significant amount of time as an undergrad student taking part in the SMU Law community and it has been a refreshing experience so far. 3. What has been your favorite class and why? My favorite class has been Legislation and Regulation because in this new world that is law school, it most reminds me of my political science background from undergrad. We examine the formulaic structures of our American legislative, judicial, and executive system while also looking at how the relationships between these branches impact our day to day lives. 4. When you are not in school or studying, what do you do for fun? When I am not in school or studying, I like to spend some time with my family and friends as well as engage in self-care activities like meditation and walks through nature. 5. What extracurricular activities have you enjoyed most and why? (SBA, moot court, etc.) I have enjoyed taking part in BLSA the most, especially meeting other talented and hardworking upperclassmen who take such a vested interest in upholding diversity and fellowship on campus! 6. How has law school challenged you most? Law school has challenged in every way imaginable, but learning how to manage one’s time and maintain one’s sense of peace in an environment that lends itself to feelings of self doubt and anxiety has been the most pivotal lessons I’ve had to tackle this semester. 7. What has been your most memorable law school moment so far? My most memorable law school moment so far has to be when I attended the Fall Festival event, and I had the opportunity really immerse myself in a school sponsored event and engage with my fellow classmates, upperclassmen, and some faculty outside of an academic context. I recall having an enjoyable sense of ease and peace for those few hours, and I needed that reset during the semester. 8. What do you plan to do post-graduation? Although I am open to all possibilities, I do intend to hopefully work in a large or mid size firm with an emphasis on business/corporate affairs. 9. Have you had any important mentors during law school? If so, who? Two important mentors I have had during law school include Dean Yeager of SMU Law’s Office of Student Affairs and Christine Leatherberry, Director of SMU Law’s Alumni Relations. Those two individuals have been a calming force in what feels like a tsunami at times, and I am deeply grateful for all of the advice they’ve parted me before and during law school. Their combined experience as former attorneys and emphasis on maintaining a healthy wellbeing in this demanding profession both serve to uplift the students here at SMU Dedman School of Law. We are lucky to have them! 10. Where do you see yourself in 5 and 10 years? In five years, I look forward to earning my law degree and working in a supportive yet stimulating environment where my skills can be put to meaningful use. In 10 years, I see myself working towards my goals of starting a family, using my skills to give back to underprivileged communities, and progressing in my legal career. In the meantime, I shall embrace the unpredictable test that is life along the way!

Cristina Mauldin, Class of 2025 - SMU Dedman School of Law Skip to main content SMU Explore SMU Academics Undergraduate Admission Student Affairs About SMU News Athletics Events Calendar George W. Bush Presidential Center Prospective Students Current Students Alumni Information for Faculty & Staff Apply to SMUGIVE NOW Dedman School of Law Menu Search Admissions Student Profiles Cristina Mauldin, Class of 2025 Cristina Mauldin, Class of 2025 Tell us about yourself. My name is Cristina Mauldin, and I am a 1L at SMU Dedman School of Law. I graduated from Southern Methodist University in 2020 with majors in Spanish and Education and minors in Philosophy and Religious Studies. I spent the past two years teaching middle and high school Spanish in Duncanville ISD and Dallas ISD, respectively. While I have been interested in law since I was a kid, teaching Spanish influenced my interest in practicing education law specifically. My teaching career was extremely challenging and impactful, and my goal is to use my legal education to help future teachers to shape their work environment in a way that helps them to best serve their students. When I am not reading or studying, my favorite things to do are reformer Pilates, AMP cycle, lifting weights, shopping and visiting with my family. Why did you decide to come to SMU Law? I decided to come to SMU Law because I had an incredible experience at SMU in undergrad, and I love being in the Dallas area. I was also honored to be selected as a Sumners Scholar, which further incentivized me to choose SMU. What has been your favorite thing about SMU Law and why? My favorite thing about SMU Law so far has been the student experience. I have loved getting a chance to be on the other side of the classroom by being a student again. I have been what I think will be lifelong friends in some of my classmates, and I have found that every 1L class has been unique and interesting. Just the other day, I attended my first office hours of law school with Professor Offit. She was very helpful and kind, and it set a positive tone for what I think will be an incredible semester in her Criminal Law class. When you are not in school or studying, what do you do for fun? I absolutely love to exercise because it has been extremely beneficial for my physical and mental wellness these past few years. My favorite form of exercise is reformer Pilates, which is a low-impact form of strength, core, and flexibility training that involves a fun piece of equipment called a reformer. It’s my favorite because there are endless possibilities for exercises. Other than that, I love visiting my family, shopping, and eating at Malai Kitchen. What extracurricular activities did you enjoy most in college and why? My favorite extracurricular activities in college were singing Soprano 2 in the SMU Belle Tones and playing intramural sand volleyball for Armstrong Commons. As a Belle Tone, I got to be a soloist in both Carrie Underwood’s Before He Cheats and Tina Turner’s Proud Mary, and I was a small part of an incredibly talented group of women. We never won the commons championship for intramural sand volleyball, but we did win runner-up my senior year! How do you think law school will challenge you? I think that law school will challenge me to be more intentional about how I plan to spend my time. Before, I would have a simple to-do list of things I wanted to accomplish on a given day that dealt with work, school, and social activities. I would usually get everything done in one day, but I would push things to the next day if I did not. Now, I am working hard to be more detail oriented when I make my schedule so that I can complete my daily lists and still get enough sleep and exercise. What has been your most memorable law school moment so far? My most memorable law school moment thus far has been attending Professor Offit’s office hours. I went to her with a question about jury nullification, and we ended up having an hour-long conversation about jury nullification plus law school in general and my career goals. It made me feel more comfortable sharing my ideas in class, and I am excited to continue learning from Professor Offit about criminal law. What do you plan to do post-graduation? Post-graduation, I plan to work in labor and employment law. I hope to find a big firm to work for here in Dallas that will help to shape me into an effective attorney and provide me with the skills to do the best I can for any clients I have the privilege to help. Where do you see yourself in 5 and 10 years? In 5 years, I see myself working in labor and employment law at a big firm here in Dallas. In 10 years, I see myself starting a non-profit that provides Texas public school teachers with free assistance with signing their contracts, enrolling in their benefits programs, and handling any student, parents, or administrative concerns they have at their schools. Somewhere in between 5 and 10 years, I hope to save up enough money to build and move into my dream home either in Dallas or a suburb close by.

Bush Presidential Center Prospective Students Current Students Alumni Information for Faculty & Staff Apply to SMUGIVE NOW Dedman School of Law Menu Search Admissions Student Profiles Enrico Hernandez Enrico Hernandez, Class of 2022 Tell us about yourself (where are your from, your undergrad school, major, what you did prior to coming to SMU, anything interesting, etc.)? My name is Enrico, but everyone just calls me Enzo. I grew up in the Philippines and went to Wichita State for undergrad. I was a (professional) bowler and bowled collegiately. What is your favorite thing to do in Dallas? I love all the sporting events that you can go to in Dallas. You’ve got basketball, football, hockey, soccer, and everything else in between. Why did you decide to come to SMU Law? I decided to come to SMU because I really liked Dallas. A lawyer advised me to choose the law school that is in the city you like most and I took that advice. What advice would you give anyone applying to Law School? Take the LSAT seriously. It’s the biggest factor as far as law school admissions. What classes are you enrolled in this semester? This semester I’m taking Legislation and Regulations, Torts, Contracts, Criminal Law, and Legal Writing. When you are not in school or studying, what do you do for fun? I love basketball and football so I’ll be watching games on TV or in person. I’m also into cars so if there’s an interesting event that’s car related, I’ll probably be there as well. What extracurricular activities are you interest in at SMU Law? I’m interested joining some student organizations. I think they’re a great way to get involved with the SMU Law community and the Dallas legal community. How do you think law school will challenge you most? I’ve never been a big reader so I think that’s where the biggest challenge lies. Classes in law school require you to read and understand dozens of pages worth of information. What do you think you would like to do after graduation? I’d like to end up at a law firm that does corporate law, international law, sports law, or finance law. I’m a 1L though so that might change.

Bush Presidential Center Prospective Students Current Students Alumni Information for Faculty & Staff Apply to SMUGIVE NOW Dedman School of Law Menu Search Admissions Student Profiles Enzo Hernandez, Class of 2022 Enzo Hernandez, Class of 2022 1. Tell us about yourself. I was born and grew up in the Philippines. I came to the U.S. on a collegiate bowling scholarship and at the time was still bowling professionally for the Philippines. At some point during college, I decided that I wanted to try and make a career in the business and/or legal world. I thought this was more in line with my interests and haven’t looked back since. 2. Why did you decide to come to SMU Law? I was told by a mentor that when it comes to choosing a law school, the law school’s location is a top consideration. Based on that, SMU was a no-brainer. I visited the DFW metro area a lot while in college and really liked it. On a personal level, it’s a large enough city where there’s something for everyone. From a career standpoint, the legal and business markets are robust and still growing. 3. What has been your favorite class and why? This might be ironic for someone who wants to do transactional work, but I really enjoyed my first-year legal writing class. I’m a big fan of classes that are practical, and I think legal writing is arguably the most practical class in all of law school. It’s also the first class which gives you an idea of what being a lawyer is like. 4. When you are not in school or studying, what do you do for fun? I’m pretty laid back, so I usually spend the weekend playing video games or binge-watching TV. If I’m out and about, I go cycling around the DFW trails and parks; walk around the many shopping malls and complexes; watch the Mavs play; or enjoy the food and drinks the area has to offer. 5. What extracurricular activities have you enjoyed most and why? (SBA, moot court, etc.) I’ve really enjoyed being a mentor to law students who are more junior than me. I received a lot of great mentoring during my first year of law school, which I think helped me succeed, and I think it’s only right that I give back by also being a mentor to others. 6. How has law school challenged you most? I’m an introverted person, so I dreaded the thought of networking. Law school, however, has forced me to adapt and be more receptive of the concept. I now acknowledge the importance of networking and realize that there is value in it when you’re creating genuine relationships with other people. 7. What has been your most memorable law school moment so far? For its comedy more than anything, my most memorable law school moment is my very first law school class. During the class discussion, I remember thinking, “These people are speaking in English, and I can recognize the words they’re saying, but at this point they might as well be speaking gibberish.” I then spent the rest of the class frantically trying to figure out how to transfer into SMU’s MBA or Masters in Finance programs. My reaction in that moment is one law students probably share, and I can’t help but laugh when looking back. 8. What do you plan to do post-graduation? After graduation, I’ll be working in Katten’s Dallas office and joining its corporate group. Prior to that, I plan on traveling and making the most out of the time between the bar exam and my start date. 9. Have you had any important mentors during law school? If so, who? I’ve had the benefit of having great mentors throughout law school. Prior to law school, I received valuable advice from Dr. Borzu Sabahi, a partner in Curtis’s D.C. office. During my first year in law school, I connected with Ashley Yen, in-house counsel at Methodist Health System, and she’s since been a tremendous resource. And finally, I’ve had the guidance and support of the associates and partners from Katten’s Dallas office. 10. Where do you see yourself in 5 and 10 years? In five years, I see myself as an associate at a large firm. In ten years, I see myself making partner, also at a large firm. I don’t think these are concrete plans, however, and I fully intend to be open to all other opportunities presented. Regardless of where I am in my career, I want to make the decision that makes the most sense.

Candidate 2021 and Tax LL.M. 2022 Floy Gaidarski, J.D. Candidate 2021 and Tax LL.M. 2022 1. Tell us about yourself. I grew up in Dallas, Texas. Most of my professional colleagues know me as a suited go-getter who leads non-profits when she’s not too busy studying business law or negotiating across the nation. But in the evenings or on weekends, I trade my Hugo Boss for Saucony to rack up miles sprinting up Northaven Trail or pedaling around White Rock Lake on my Cannondale Ultegra, reminiscent of training days for the Ironman Triathlon that I completed in Zurich, Switzerland. 2. Why did you decide to come to SMU Law? I decided to attend SMU Dedman School of Law to pursue training in business law and establish a client base in Dallas. I was especially drawn to the Business Law Leadership Program and transactional opportunities provided by the Robert B. Rowling Center for Business Law & Leadership—which has been incredibly supportive of my ambitions. Because of SMU’s unique corporate law curriculum, I was able to achieve national recognition from the American Bar Association for negotiation and drafting in M&A, to earn the national championship title of “The Closer” for skillful dealmaking, and to realize my dream job. 3. What has been your favorite class and why? My favorite class was Corporate Finance and Acquisitions with Professor Steven Smathers, Chief Legal Counsel for Sowell & Co., because his class was a conversation. And (nerd alert) the exam was fun! Representing a buyout firm, I analyzed the potential acquisition of a private Texas-Louisiana healthcare company and advised on acquisition structure, capital structure, and risk. Assessing the target’s key revenues from services to Medicare patients by branches with quasi-monopolies along the southern coast, I calculated hurricane-related business interruption risk and gauged state policy trends on license moratoriums to artfully discount cash flows and qualify my comparable companies analysis. 4. When you are not in school or studying, what do you do for fun? I love hanging out with my dogs and my siblings. It’s always one more round of Catan, Codenames, or Mario Kart at the Gaidarski House in Dallas or in between off-road skiing shenanigans and downhill racing at our annual, epic ski trip to Utah. 5. What extracurricular activities have you enjoyed most and why? I have most enjoyed serving SMU’s Board of Advocates to shape the future of transactional law opportunities at SMU and to mentor students interested in corporate law. I was honored to be recognized by the Board for client advocacy in dealmaking as a Master Advocate, a title traditionally reserved for talented future litigators who excel in moot court and mock trial. As a volunteer and Rowling Scholar, I am thrilled to be a part of the Board and the Rowling Center’s mission of marking SMU Law as a university nationally renowned for a competitive transactional and business law curriculum. 6. How has law school challenged you most? A favorite professor once warned me that, “sometimes good is good enough.” Committing to good and eschewing perfect when the moment calls is crucial to success in law school. I have begrudgingly accepted that I don’t have 48 hours in a day needed to be Super Woman in everything—at least for now. I’ve learned to prioritize matters that merit 1000% percent effort above those matters suited to be good enough. 7. What has been your most memorable law school moment so far? Working with Professor Carla Reyes on The Closer’s deal file under a 24-hour crunch was the most memorable moment in law school. It was mind-blowing to strategize 1-1 with a genius who loves legal education as much as I do. Professor Reyes’s ongoing contribution to law at large is incredible; check out her current project on the legal nature, use, and transfer of digital assets at UNIDROIT International Institute for the Unification of Private Law. 8. What do you plan to do post-graduation? After graduation, I will obtain a Master of Laws in Taxation to complement my future corporate practice with Locke Lord LLP. I can’t wait to rejoin my brilliant team as a full-time associate next fall. I am thankful to hiring partner Will Becker, recruiting coordinator Ashley Hightower, summer mentorship team—Jack Jacobsen, Chrissy Metcalf, Kelsey French, and Sahil Nooruddin—and Partners Don Glendenning, Whit Roberts, Kevin Twining, Jason Schumacher, and Philip Bush, who gave me substantial work experience in private equity, energy, and restructuring. 9. Have you had any important mentors during law school? Director Eric Hinton of the Rowling Center for Business Law & Leadership has been a solid mentor and role model. When I endeavor, he sponsors; when I imagine, he engineers. SMU Law students are lucky to have Director Hinton substantiate business law opportunities—like the Business Law Boot Camp, the Corporate Counsel Externship Program, and the Business Law Concentration—through which students can master the multi-faceted practice of business law and network with executives across industries. 10. Where do you see yourself in 5 and 10 years? I will be a partner at the firm and adjunct professor at SMU Law. I also see Goldendoodles. Lots of Goldendoodles.

Bush Presidential Center Prospective Students Current Students Alumni Information for Faculty & Staff Apply to SMUGIVE NOW Dedman School of Law Menu Search Admissions Student Profiles Jacob Durst, Class of 2022 Jacob Durst, Class of 2022 1. Tell us about yourself. I’m a current 3L from Dallas, Texas. After attending high school in the area, I attended Emory University to study Business and Finance. After spending a summer working in the industry (and deciding it wasn’t for me), I decided to also major in Political Science. That love of the political system and process led me to spend two years after college working as a congressional staffer in the U.S. House of Representatives. While I enjoyed my time on the Hill, I always pictured myself as a lawyer, which led me to apply and to attend law school. 2. Why did you decide to come to SMU Law? After spending six years outside of the state of Texas, and with a desire to practice in the Dallas area, I was mainly looking at law schools in the state. I ended considering options both in and out of state, but eventually decided that SMU married the best of the things that mattered most to me — the ability to spend a lot of time with my friends and family and to have a great opportunity to work in the Dallas area. 3. What has been your favorite class and why? White Collar Crime with Professor Shipchandler. He did a great job of combining an interesting subject with his real-world practice experience and really made the subject come alive. 4. When you are not in school or studying, what do you do for fun? I’m a big basketball and live music fan. So you can usually find me at the gym playing basketball with friends or at a live music venue somewhere. 5. What extracurricular activities have you enjoyed most and why? (SBA, moot court, etc.) I’ve definitely spent the most time with the Federalist Society and the SMU Law Review Association (SMULRA). I’m thankful that through the Federalist Society we’ve been able to bring high-quality speakers and topics to campus, and SMULRA has been integral to my development as a lawyer and professional. So, they’ve each contributed a lot to my SMU experience in different ways. 6. How has law school challenged you most? The transition coming back to school after working definitely was difficult at first, but I think that it ultimately helped me out and has made things easier. 7. What has been your most memorable law school moment so far? I cannot imagine my law school experience without the friends that I’ve made here. They have enriched my time here in so many ways and have pushed me to be both a better lawyer and person. 8. What do you plan to do post-graduation? I’ll be spending a year at the Dallas office of K&L Gates before clerking with a judge on the Northern District of Texas. 9. Have you had any important mentors during law school? If so, who? Judge Wes Hendrix has been a great mentor to me and I’m eternally grateful for his wisdom and advice. I also would not be anywhere close to the lawyer that I am today without the guidance of Debbie Sanchez and Mike McCollum at the SMU Law Criminal Clinic. I’d like to thank them all for taking me under their respective wings. 10. Where do you see yourself in 5 and 10 years? I hope to be a better lawyer than I am today, to be in a position to help my community, and to be practicing in the Dallas area.

Bush Presidential Center Prospective Students Current Students Alumni Information for Faculty & Staff Apply to SMUGIVE NOW Dedman School of Law Menu Search Admissions Student Profiles James Nichols Dimento, Class of 2022 James Nichols Dimento, Class of 2022 1. Tell us about yourself. I’m a 3L from Memphis, TN and a TCU Alumni with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science and Communication Studies. I have been involved in sports my entire life, starting out as a competitive fencer growing up and eventually a Manager for TCU Men’s Basketball. I came to SMU law hoping to combine my love of sports with a legal background in order to pursue a career in sports law. 2. Why did you decide to come to SMU Law? After attending TCU, I fell completely in love with Texas and the DFW area, and wanted to come to a law school that provided me the best education while at the same time providing the connections necessary to establish a career in the place I have come to call home. For those reasons, SMU was #1 on my list from the moment I started applying to law schools, and was ecstatic to be given the opportunity to attend this great university. 3. What has been your favorite class and why? Either Contracts or Antitrust. First, because both of these classes were taught by my favorite Professor, Dean Rogers, who immediately recognized my love of sports and made sure to call on me whenever a case or fact pattern related to my area of expertise (whether I was prepared or not). Second, both of these classes were where I realized that I could use the same mental process I had used to analyze sports and apply these to the legal setting. 4. When you are not in school or studying, what do you do for fun? Watch basketball, play golf, and go on walks with my dog, Alfie. 5. What extracurricular activities have you enjoyed most and why? (SBA, moot court, etc.) Last spring, I was a part of the Mock Trial team for the Tulane Baseball Arbitration Competition. This sports law competition required us to make legal arguments using baseball statistics and analysis in an arbitration setting. I loved the opportunity to combine my legal and sports knowledge in a competitive setting, while having the chance to make some great connections in sports law. I was very proud that we were the first SMU team to win our Group of 10 and advance to the quarterfinals, and plan on competing again this year and bring home the championship for SMU Law! 6. How has law school challenged you most? Law school has challenged because from your first day of 1L it forces you to not only learn an entirely new field, but to learn a new way of thinking. You have to completely change how you learn and analyze situations, but once this way of thinking clicks it is one of the most rewarding things I’ve ever done in an academic setting. 7. What has been your most memorable law school moment so far? Being the first SMU team at the Tulane Baseball Arbitration to win our group of 10 and advance to the quarterfinals. Looking to the future, I am excited to be a part of SMU’s Corporate Counsel Externship program and be working with the Big 12 Conference this fall. 8. What do you plan to do post-graduation? Post-graduation, I hope to be working in sports, possibly the NBA. My dream is too combine the lessons I learned as a part of the TCU Men’s Basketball Team with my legal knowledge to help a NBA team win a title. 9. Where do you see yourself in 5 and 10 years? Working in the front office of an NBA Team (since I’m in Dallas now, Go Mavericks!). It has always been my dream for my career to be spent working towards winning a title, as this kind of environment has always been where I am at my best.

Bush Presidential Center Prospective Students Current Students Alumni Information for Faculty & Staff Apply to SMUGIVE NOW Dedman School of Law Menu Search Admissions Student Profiles J. D. Rimann, Class of 2022 J. D. Rimann, Class of 2022 1. Tell us about yourself. I grew up in Austin. After high school I spent over a year volunteering in Sierra Leone and Togo with Mercy Ships, a Christian NGO which operates the world’s largest civilian hospital ship. When I came back to Texas, I worked my way through community college by flipping burgers at In-N-Out, before transferring to the University of Southern Mississippi. At Southern Miss I met my wife Courtney and graduated with a triple-major and triple-minor. Following college, I worked in and around Texas politics and government for a few years before Courtney and I decided we would attend law school together. What we didn’t count on was ending up in the same section, but things worked out alright in the end! 2. Why did you decide to come to SMU Law? Courtney and I wanted to stay in Texas for law school. Most of our family is here and we wanted to stay close by. We applied to each law school in Texas, but particularly liked SMU’s campus and the people we met while touring. Once I was awarded the Hatton W. Sumners Scholarship, SMU Law was the clear winner. 3. What has been your favorite class and why? Very difficult to pick just one class here, so I am going to hedge and pick three: one for each year of law school. My favorite 1L course was Torts with Professor Bavli. My favorite 2L class was Creditor’s Rights with Judge Harlin Hale. And my favorite 3L class was Advanced Contracts with Professor Glenn West, a long-time Weil partner who taught the seminar as an adjunct. Though covering different materials, each of these classes contained the same basic ingredients: a professor who deeply cared about their subject and their students, significant intellectual rigor, and an opportunity to creatively and imaginatively use the law once you understood the basics. 4. When you are not in school or studying, what do you do for fun? Read. More than anything else I love reading and fill up most of my free time with it. Mostly business history, military history, and linguistics. Otherwise, I do a lot of running and rucking to stay in shape for the Army. During 3L I have also tried to acquire a couple new skills. I have been cooking my way through Mark Bittman’s How to Cook Everything: The Basics, much to the amusement of my wife. And her and I have started taking golf lessons together, which has been fun. 5. What extracurricular activities have you enjoyed most and why? (ROTC, SBA, moot court, etc.) My two favorite extracurricular activities have been ROTC and mock trial. ROTC has been a significant time commitment, but well worth it: I have dreamed of being an Army officer since I was a child hearing stories from my father and grandfather about the military. And I have always felt that all citizens in our Republic have a responsibility to serve their fellow citizens as best they can. For me, that was joining the military. Plus, ROTC (and serving as an enlisted cadet in the Army National Guard since 2L) was a nice break from law school: spending time each week with different people studying a different subject was an enjoyment in itself. While you have to stay on top of your time, I would encourage any students interested in commissioning as an officer to explore ROTC as one option. And that goes for commissioning as a JAG or not—I actually commissioned as a military intelligence officer. 6. How has law school challenged you most? Both the biggest challenge and the biggest reward of law school was attending it with my wife, Courtney. We had been married for about two years before attending. During our time together we had experienced two political campaigns, two legislative sessions, and what we felt was a significant amount of stress. None of it compared to our first year in law school together. We were in the same section, on the same curve, competing for the same grades. At one point we interviewed at the same law firm, me in the morning and her in the afternoon. And we are both type-A, extremely competitive people. As you might imagine, it was an intense year. Ultimately, we had to make a commitment to love each other as Christ has called us to: unconditionally, sacrificially, and in a spirit of humility. We vowed to see each other’s success as our own and to support each other even if it meant our own grades or job prospects or other opportunities might suffer. Seeing our marriage get stronger and stronger throughout law school ended up being by far the most rewarding outcome of all. 7. What has been your most memorable law school moment so far? The most memorable moment was graduation. Because Courtney graduated immediately before me, she was able to turn around and hood me as a family hooder. Hearing Dean Yeager say the words “John Daniel Rimann, hooded by his wife Courtney E. Rimann, class of 2022” was a moment that will stick with me for the rest of my life! 8. What do you plan to do post-graduation? Following the bar, I will join the Dallas office of Gibson Dunn & Crutcher, before clerking for a federal district judge in a couple years. On the Army side, I will join the Oklahoma National Guard’s 45th Infantry Brigade Combat Team as a military intelligence officer. 9. Have you had any important mentors during law school? If so, who? My most important mentors in the law school were Professor Hillel Bavli and Judge Harlin Hale, whose courses I took and whose advice and insight I have greatly benefited from, and Judge Brantley Starr, who I had the wonderful opportunity to work for through the Federal Judicial Externship program. Outside the law school, my most important mentors were former Texas appellate justice Michael Toth, whose judicial election campaign I had the opportunity to manage prior to law school, and SMU alum Barry McBee, who along his wife Susanna have been incredible mentors to Courtney and I since well before we came to SMU. 10. Where do you see yourself in 5 and 10 years? In five years, I think I will still be working at my firm, or perhaps becoming a federal prosecutor. And in the Army, I will be looking at a promotion to Captain and considering what my long-term future role will be. In ten years, I really could not say. Even five years feels far away right now!

Bush Presidential Center Prospective Students Current Students Alumni Information for Faculty & Staff Apply to SMUGIVE NOW Dedman School of Law Menu Search Admissions Student Profiles Joy Hetrick, Class of 2023 Joy Hetrick, Class of 2023 1. Tell us about yourself. I am a rising 3L here at SMU Law. I am originally from Prescott, AZ and received my Bachelor's of Art from the University of Arizona in 2013. After graduating college, I moved to Texas to marry my fiancé, Ben. Soon after, I became an activist for the disabled community and spent the next 8 years working for and volunteering for local nonprofit organizations serving the disabled community. In addition, I worked in the Legal Department of G6 Hospitality. While I have always dreamed of going to Law School, everything I learned at G6 encouraged me to take that next step. 2. Why did you decide to come to SMU Law? When I decided to attend law school, I knew SMU was the place for me. SMU Law has a reputation for excellence in corporate law and public service - two things near to my heart. I was also eager to take part in the experiential learning opportunities SMU Law had to offer, such as the Judge Elmo B. Hunter Clinic and learning the art of oral advocacy by doing moot court through the Board of Advocates. 3. What has been your favorite class and why? Criminal Law, taught by Professor Ruben, has been at the top of the list. Although I don't want to practice criminal law, I learned so much about how the law functions and the practical issues attorneys have to deal with as they defend and prosecute individuals. It was a fascinating course and truly eye-opening. 4. When you are not in school or studying, what do you do for fun? I love to take long walks with my husband and work in my garden. (I don't have a green thumb just yet but I love to practice!) 5. What extracurricular activities have you enjoyed most and why? (SBA, moot court, etc.) The Board of Advocates has been the most rewarding extracurricular activity at SMU Law. Participating in moot court has allowed me to meet great attorneys, build new friendships, improve my research and writing skills, and learn the art of oral advocacy. 6. How has law school challenged you most? The most challenging part of law school is balancing time. It can be difficult to read, study, outline, attend extracurricular events, and still spend time with family. Learning to strike the right balance was challenging, but once there, makes everything much easier. 7. What has been your most memorable law school moment so far? There have been so many excellent moments in law school! One of my most humbling and exciting moments was when learning that I was selected to receive the Texas General Council Forum Scholarship this semester. I am looking forward to attending the Robert H. Dedman Award for Ethics and Law Dinner later this month. Also, arguing with my friends before three distinguished judges during the Lynn Pinker Moot Court competition probably takes the cake. And finally, dunking Dean Yeager in a water tank during the 2021 Boo Bash law school event. 🙂 8. What do you plan to do post-graduation? I plan to practice real estate law with a firm in Dallas. 9. Have you had any important mentors during law school? If so, who? Yes. A few upperclassmen, Randee Williams-Koeller, Walker Smith, and Marisa Thompson have each been instrumental in helping me navigate some law school uncertainties. In addition, each of my Moot Court Coaches, Ryan Jones, Katherine Handy, Lance Caughfield, and Haleigh Jones, have passed on so much knowledge, encouragement, and wisdom in helping shape me to be a stronger advocate and successful attorney. 10. Where do you see yourself in 5 and 10 years? I see myself practicing real estate law in Dallas, volunteering with organizations like Attorneys Serving the Community, and continuing to support the disabled community in DFW.

Bush Presidential Center Prospective Students Current Students Alumni Information for Faculty & Staff Apply to SMUGIVE NOW Dedman School of Law Menu Search Admissions Student Profiles Luke Nguyen, Class of 2024 Luke Nguyen, Class of 2024 1. Tell us about yourself. I am currently a 1L from Old Lyme, Connecticut, and I attended Amherst College undergrad where I majored in Political Science. I spent the last two years working as a legal assistant in Boston, supporting patent lawyers on various tasks. I moved down to Dallas in July, and I have loved getting acquainted with the city this past year! 2. Why did you decide to come to SMU Law? When I was applying to law schools, I knew I wanted to be in a city that was growing. After spending time in Dallas and talking to a few people familiar with the legal market, it became clear that the city was the perfect place. Once I decided on Dallas, SMU became a no-brainer. The students and faculty were incredibly warm and inviting, and it offered me the opportunity to grow as a student and a person. 3. What has been your favorite class and why? My favorite class thus far has been Contracts with Professor Crespi! What I’ve loved about it is being able to learn the legal side of contracts we hear about and encounter every day. It has also been interesting learning about the evolution contract law paralleled with our growth as a society. 4. When you are not in school or studying, what do you do for fun? I played soccer in college and it was a major part of my life growing up. I have loved playing with a group of 1Ls this year! I have also spent a lot of time on a quest to find the best Mexican food in Dallas and exploring the different charms of the city. 5. What extracurricular activities have you enjoyed most and why? (SBA, moot court, etc.) My favorite extracurricular club has been APALSA. I’ve really appreciated the support and guidance from the upperclassmen. It has also been wonderful meeting other Asian lawyers in Dallas. I am excited to explore more clubs and activities in the next two years and continuing to be a part of APALSA. 6. How has law school challenged you most? The most challenging part about law school has been learning things that are completely foreign at a rapid pace. Also, it was a challenge being back in the classroom after working for two years, but I was lucky to have a great group of friends to lean on this first year! 7. What has been your most memorable law school moment so far? My most memorable moment of law school was finishing the final exam of the first semester! Chatting with my friends after the last exam, it became clear that we learned an incredible amount in just four months. It was easy to forget during the semester how much we’d grown, and it was gratifying taking a step back and reflecting on the semester. 8. What do you plan to do post-graduation? I’m not sure exactly what I want to do after graduation, but I am currently interested in healthcare law. I come from a family of doctors, so I have always felt a connection the field. I have also developed an interest in sports and entertainment law! I am hoping to spend this summer exploring as many fields as possible. 9. Have you had any important mentors during law school? If so, who? Professor Mayo, my torts professor, certainly made the transition to law school a bit easier! I felt comfortable going to his office hours and discussing the challenges I was having in Torts and other classes. I have also enjoyed learning more about healthcare law from him, and I am excited to take his health law class next semester. 10. Where do you see yourself in 5 and 10 years? First, I see myself as being a great dog parent to the new puppy I am getting at the end of the semester! Professionally, I hope to be working in a role in which I am challenged every day and in a position to ensure diverse populations have a voice in the legal profession.

Bush Presidential Center Prospective Students Current Students Alumni Information for Faculty & Staff Apply to SMUGIVE NOW Dedman School of Law Menu Search Admissions Student Profiles Mackenzie Arnold, Class of 2024 Mackenzie Arnold, Class of 2024 1. Tell us about yourself. My name is Mackenzie Arnold, and I am a first-year student at SMU Dedman School of Law. I grew up in a DFW suburb, but after spending some time in Alabama (and London for a semester) for undergrad, I decided to come back and lay my roots in the great state of Texas. 2. Why did you decide to come to SMU Law? I decided to come to SMU Law because I missed Texas and knew I wanted to make it my forever home. However, for someone who had spent their whole life in the DFW area, I had never been to SMU’s campus. I flew back home for a weekend to tour the law school and was sold after meeting some great students and faculty. 3. What has been your favorite class and why? My favorite class so far has been legal writing. Coming to law school with a Bachelor of Arts in English, I was warned by some professors that I probably would not like legal writing compared to what I had been doing in my English classes at the time. That could not have been more incorrect. I find joy in researching answers and crafting articulate and succinct writing pieces. 4. When you are not in school or studying, what do you do for fun? Other than reading casebooks, some things I enjoy are training for marathons, recreating Great British Baking Show Creations, and finding a comfy chair to cozy up in to read a great work of fiction. I’m happiest when I’m outside (when the weather is between 55-85 degrees preferably) and enjoy always being busy and moving. 5. What extracurricular activities have you enjoyed most and why? (SBA, moot court, etc.) When I came to law school, I took advantage of the “Meet the Organizations” Fair and joined a fair number of clubs/societies. However, the ones I’ve enjoyed most are the ones I’ve taken the deepest dive into. I was elected to be the SBA representative for my 1L section, and I have enjoyed that immensely because I have gotten to know my section and see the behind-the-scenes workings at the law school. Another honorable mention would be the Christian Legal Society. Spending time in community weekly with a fellow group of law students with shared values and goals has been extremely encouraging. 6. How has law school challenged you most? Law school has forced me to face failure constantly but remain resilient as I strive to overcome concepts and classes that do not come to me so quickly. I have always been the student who has outworked everyone else and subsequently reaped the rewards. Law school is different, and everyone is exceptionally bright and hard-working, so I’ve had to push myself even harder to understand new concepts and prepare for unfamiliar exam materials. 7. What has been your most memorable law school moment so far? I’m not sure if there’s a specific moment in mind, but there’s a particular place. Any time the weather is slightly bearable, you can find me out on the law quad. Whether I’m eating a meal, reading through a casebook, or chatting with a fellow classmate, I love to be sitting at one of the tables left out there. I’ve had so many amazing conversations and met so many wonderful people just by being present and available on that beautiful green lawn. 8. What do you plan to do post-graduation? Currently, I am leaning towards obtaining a judicial clerkship post-graduation. I love legal research and writing and foresee myself going the litigation route, so that seems to be a great next step. After that, I’m not exactly positive, but I’m leaning toward working in criminal or family law (or hopefully somewhere where those two things intersect). 9. Have you had any important mentors during law school? If so, who? So far, the best mentors I have had in law school would be two amazing women within the Career Services Office. My assigned advisor is kind, knowledgeable, and extremely helpful. But I’ve been so lucky to also be in touch with another team member who works more with the judicial internship/clerkship side of things, and she has also proven to be indispensable to me. I also keep in touch with my two mentors from undergrad, who are still prevalent resources for me. 10. Where do you see yourself in 5 and 10 years? In five years, I see myself settling into my legal career after finishing law school and wrapping up my judicial clerkship. I am currently leaning towards spending my legal career in the public/government sector working as a litigator. In ten years, I foresee myself continuing to work my way up in my career, with many trials under my belt, having laid my permanent roots in the DFW area.

Madison Huerta, Class of 2022 - SMU Dedman School of Law Skip to main content SMU Explore SMU Academics Undergraduate Admission Student Affairs About SMU News Athletics Events Calendar George W. Bush Presidential Center Prospective Students Current Students Alumni Information for Faculty & Staff Apply to SMUGIVE NOW Dedman School of Law Menu Search Admissions Student Profiles Madison Huerta, Class of 2022 Madison Huerta, Class of 2022 1. Tell us about yourself. I am a third-year law student interested in the intersection of law and policy. I grew up in Seabrook, Texas, where I spent my time playing competitive sports, enjoying the beach with family and friends, and involving myself in community and school organizations. I received my undergraduate degree from the University of Texas at Austin, McCombs School of Business, where I was elected to serve as Speaker of the Student Government Assembly and worked at the Texas Capitol. I love spending time outdoors, meeting new people, and Texas. 2. Why did you decide to come to SMU Law? After attending a large public undergraduate program, I knew that I wanted to be a part of a smaller, more personal community for graduate school. I was initially attracted to SMU Law because of its location in Dallas. However, the public service hour graduation requirement and the opportunity to work in the Hunter Legal Clinic for Victims of Crimes against Women were my deciding factors. I wanted to experience public interest work and I knew that I would have that opportunity at SMU Law. 3. What has been your favorite class and why? My time working in the Hunter Legal Clinic has been my favorite because it has been the most transformative class for me. In class I learned practical skillsets that not only prepared me to serve my client but taught me to look at the world differently. My co-counsel and I also had the opportunity to advocate for our client in a formal hearing. We researched the law, filed an appeal, wrote a brief, prepared and executed a direct-examination, and argued in front of a judge. For me this was a meaningful moment because everything I learned in law school immediately became relevant and had prepared me for that experience. 4. When you are not in school or studying, what do you do for fun? I am an avid fan of women’s soccer and Texas football. But when I am not following the U.S. Women’s National team or the longhorns, you can find me at White Rock Lake running or paddle boarding. I also enjoy following Texas politics and volunteering for local campaigns. 5. What extracurricular activities have you enjoyed most and why? (SBA, moot court, etc.) This is a difficult question because I have truly been enriched by all of my extracurricular activities. After two years on my mock trial team, I have become a stronger, more confident advocate. Even more importantly my coaches have imparted on my team the importance of being a good human being with strong moral character inside and outside of the courtroom regardless of the circumstances. I have also enjoyed my time in the Student Bar Association, as a representative and vice president. We were faced with the challenge of uniting our community as we returned to campus after COVID-19, and we have worked hard to contribute to re-establishing a strong community of students and faculty on campus. Lastly, I came to law school with an interest in public interest work and serving as the President of the Association of Public Interest law has allowed me to promote public service on campus which has been rewarding. 6. How has law school challenged you most? My biggest challenge in law school has been rising to the level of my peers while not losing sight of the reasons that I came to law school. It is an amazing experience to constantly be around smart, driven individuals. It has also been easy to get distracted by their goals and to lose sight of my goals amongst all the competition. But three years later, I am better because of my peers, and my desire to pursue my ambitions is stronger than ever. 7. What has been your most memorable law school moment so far? While I was working in the Hunter Legal Clinic, the Texas Legislature was in session. My team and I worked with the Lonestar Justice Alliance to write a white paper for a bill that would help survivors of abuse. When the bill was heard in committee, we drove to Austin with our professor to testify in support of that bill. Before law school, I worked for the Legislature for three sessions, and it was a full circle moment for me to be back in the Texas Capitol as an SMU Law student advocating for women. 8. What do you plan to do post-graduation? After graduation I plan to move back to Austin and do policy and regulatory work. 9. Have you had any important mentors during law school? If so, who? I have been fortunate to have many important mentors during law school. Professor Nanasi, my clinic professor, has taught me how to be an empathetic human being, a patient listener, and a passionate advocate in addition to teaching me how to think critically and everything else that comes with practicing law in the clinic. My mock trial coach, Allison Reppond, has dedicated countless hours to teaching me how to be a strong and compelling female advocate both in the courtroom and as a professional in general. Lastly, Rachael Jones, my supervising attorney during my summer at the U.S. Attorney’s Office, took me under her wing and exposed me to incredible opportunities to learn about the inner-working of our justice system. She also showed me what it means to truly love your work. Because of these women, I am empowered to confidently pursue my highest ambitions. 10. Where do you see yourself in 5 and 10 years? In 5 years, I see myself continuing to learn and grow in the practice of law; continuing to be mentored and to mentor; and using my knowledge to add value to my clients and the legal community. In 10 years, I see myself working towards serving in some type of state policy making role. If law school has shown me anything, it is that our laws and policies have a direct effect on individuals. And when laws are written poorly or don’t consider all communities equally, they have detrimental effects on our society. I want to do my part in creating laws that include and consider all Texans, especially our most vulnerable populations.

Bush Presidential Center Prospective Students Current Students Alumni Information for Faculty & Staff Apply to SMUGIVE NOW Dedman School of Law Menu Search Admissions Student Profiles Melanie Griffin Melanie Griffin, Class of 2022 Tell us about yourself (where you are from, your undergrad school, major, what you did prior to coming to SMU, anything interesting, etc.)? I am from Little Rock, Arkansas. I went to the University of Central Arkansas where I attained my Bachelor of Art in History and African American Studies. I graduated in December of 2018 which allowed me to work and save prior to moving to Dallas. I decided I did not want to work for anyone, I wanted to be my own boss. I began promoting my photography, and to my surprised I gained tons of clients. I began making money by doing something I absolutely loved. Over the course of five months I was able to save enough money to fund my move to Dallas. What is your favorite thing to do in Dallas? My favorite thing about Dallas would definitely be the abundance of tacos! Why did you decide to come to SMU Law? Before I submitted my application to SMU Law I had a lot of self-doubt. I began to think “they’ll never accept me!” I spoke with alumni and current students and asked them about their experience at SMU. All of them assured me that SMU Law was one of THE schools to attend if I wanted to live in Texas. After I submitted my application and received my acceptance letter I got a call from Ms. Shunverie in the office of admissions. Her excitement through the phone immediately made me feel welcomed, and my anxiety began to disappear. Finally, I compared all of the schools I got accepted into, and determined SMU Law was the school for me. What advice would you give anyone applying to Law School? The advice I would give to anyone applying to Law School is get to know the people who are already attending that institution. Asking questions about the environment of the law school is very important because that environment is what you will be submerged in for the next three to four years. I would also advise taking advantage of waivers. Law school applications are expensive, and if you’re able to attain a waiver to offset the cost, do it! What classes are you enrolled in this semester? I am enrolled in Torts, Contracts, Criminal Law, Legal Research, Writing, and Advocacy, and Legislation and Regulation. When you are not in school or studying, what do you do for fun? When I am not studying, I am usually thinking about cases. Now that I have started law school the law is all I think about! I suppose that can be a good thing or a bad thing. What extracurricular activities are you interested in at SMU Law? I would love to join the Black Law Students Association, Women in Law and Board of Advocates. How do you think law school will challenge you most? I think law school will help mold me into a more active and educated citizen. I believe every lawyer has the ability to give back in various ways, whether it is doing pro bono work or advising the president. Law is a powerful profession, and I believe SMU Law will help shape me to use my power for the betterment of my community. Although it is only my second week as a 1L, I am already learning the value of community and leadership within my 1L class. I plan to carry the traits I learn at SMU with me when I become a lawyer. What do you think you would like to do after graduation? Post-graduation I would like to take a long vacation. Following my vacation, I would like to go into litigation, however I am open-minded to other opportunities. Where ever this journey takes me, I have made a commitment to myself to always put my best foot forward. Pony-up!

Bush Presidential Center Prospective Students Current Students Alumni Information for Faculty & Staff Apply to SMUGIVE NOW Dedman School of Law Menu Search Admissions Student Profiles Michael Vuong, Class of 2023 Michael Vuong, Class of 2023 1. Tell us about yourself. SMU Dedman School of Law influenced my career path before I was even a law student. In 2011, when I was in high school, I heard the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg speak at the SMU Dedman School of Law Raggio Lecture Series. Justice Ginsburg’s life in public service inspired me then and inspires me now. In college at SMU, Professor Joe Kobylka nurtured my interest in the law when I participated in his Supreme Court Seminar. When I was in graduate school for public policy at the University of Southern California, my capstone project for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency required me to try to make sense of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. This encounter with statutory interpretation made me realize that I needed to go to law school. 2. Why did you decide to come to SMU Law? In addition to programs such as the Federal Judicial Externship Course and the extensive clinical program, I decided to attend SMU Dedman School of Law because this is a law school where students have a seat at the table when it comes to setting the direction of the law school. For example, when SMU Vice President for Academic Affairs Elizabeth Loboa invited me to serve on the Dedman School of Law Dean Search Committee, I was very grateful and honored to serve. SMU and SMU Dedman School of Law develop leaders because at this institution students have opportunities to shape the future of this university and law school. 3. What has been your favorite class and why? Professor Dale Carpenter teaches Constitutional Law I with great wit and wisdom. Like an orchestra conductor, Professor Carpenter masterfully directs many voices and arguments in his use of the Socratic method. For example, in our class periods where he led an exigesis of Marbury v. Madison, Professor Carpenter’s juxtaposition of many modalities of interpretation gradually taught me how to appreciate and evaluate the dialogues between cases and justices. 4. When you are not in school or studying, what do you do for fun? Walks at White Rock Lake, yoga, and classical music have sustained me through the stresses of law school. I also love to plan events because I believe in the importance of bringing people together. Throughout 1L and the summer after 1L, I hosted 5 online events and 6 outdoor happy hours for the class of 2023. Also, as the public relations director for the National Asian Pacific American Law Student Association, it made me very happy to enable law students from across the country to meet with attorneys for Zoom workshops on everything from how to apply for a public interest fellowship to how to plan for 2L summer internships. 5. What extracurricular activities have you enjoyed most and why? (SBA, moot court, etc.) Serving as a staff editor for the International Law Review Association (ILRA) has been one of the best academic and professional development experiences I have had in law school because of the opportunities to grow as a researcher, writer, and editor. I appreciate the positive and inclusive environment that ILRA President Divya Advani has created. Also, ILRA Case Note & Comment Editor and 3L Mary "Molly" Schultz provided great guidance and feedback as I wrote my case note, and I share the Best Case Note Award with Molly. 6. How has law school challenged you most? Normally, I’m quite independent and keep my own counsel, but law school challenged me to rethink that approach. In 1L, I realized the importance of asking for help and seeking out mentorship. In Civil Procedure, Professor Elizabeth “Beth” Thornburg took the time to share stories about varied career paths of alums of SMU Dedman School of Law, and I credit Professor Thornburg with inspiring me to reach out to alums for Zoom chats. My weekly Zoom chat with different attorneys has been a very enriching experience. 7. What has been your most memorable law school moment so far? In fall 2021, I stood behind the podium where my professors normally stood, and as a as a TA for Legal Writing and Research for LLM Students I led an exercise about Bluebook citations. Although this experience may seem commonplace, in that moment I felt how far I had traveled in law school in one year. In early 2020, I was blissfully ignorant of the intricacies of the Bluebook. I am very grateful to Professor Heather Stobaugh for the opportunity to serve as a TA, and Professor Leo Yu was a wonderful mentor when served as his TA. 8. What do you plan to do post-graduation? As a second semester 2L, I am just over the halfway mark in law school. I will intern with two federal agencies in summer 2022, and I am preparing for applications for public interest fellowships and honors programs in the federal government. 9. Have you had any important mentors during law school? If so, who? I am grateful for the mentorship of my coaches—all SMU Dedman School of Law alums—on the Thomas Tang Moot Court team: Emily Felix, Hanna Kim, Jacob Matthew, Christina Ta, Austin Teng, and Will Tran. Among these mentors, I would like to give special thanks to Hanna Kim, an associate at Zelle LLP. I’ve been inspired by Hanna because of her example of professional achievement in her litigation practice and her leadership in the legal community through her roles in the Dallas Asian American Bar Association and the Dallas Association of Young Lawyers. I also appreciate Hanna’s work to create a new non-profit organization, The Podium, that has a mission to “amplify the voices and opportunities for Asian American women in the legal profession.” Hanna has also shared invaluable support in my leadership of the SMU Asian Pacific American Law Student Association. 10. Where do you see yourself in 5 and 10 years? Ever since I heard Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg speak at SMU, I have been committed to the public sector. In 5 years, I would like to follow in the footsteps of one of my mentors and SMU Dedman School of Law alum, An Phan, and serve as an attorney adviser in a federal agency. In 10 years, I would like to serve as a legislative counsel on a congressional committee.

Tell us about yourself. I am a 3L from Grand Prairie, Texas, and I graduated from the University of Texas in 2020 with a Bachelor of Arts in Government. On campus, I am the International Law Review Association president and a First Year Student Mentor! 2. Why did you decide to come to SMU Law? I decided to come to SMU Law because I knew I wanted to return to DFW and work in Dallas after graduation. I was also impressed with the clinical program that SMU had, including the First Amendment Clinic. Lastly, SMU has a very collegial environment where students push each other to be the best they can be. 3. What has been your favorite class and why? My favorite class at SMU has to be Professor Carpenter’s First Amendment course. I have long been fascinated by the first amendment, and it was a fantastic opportunity to learn more about it from a leading expert in the field. 4. When you are not in school or studying, what do you do for fun? When I am not in school, I like hanging out with my friends at one of the local dive bars. I also enjoy taking mental breaks by watching reality TV and supporting my Texas Longhorns. 5. What extracurricular activities have you enjoyed most and why? (ROTC, SBA, moot court, etc.) I have loved my experience on the International Law Review Association. Being on a journal has helped me sharpen my legal research and writing skills and has helped me to become a more detail-oriented person. I have also enjoyed being a first-year student mentor through the SBA. I have enjoyed welcoming our new class of 1Ls each year and being a sounding board for all their problems and accomplishments! 6. How has law school challenged you most? The most challenging part of law school is balancing your time and ensuring you don’t overcommit yourself. I also think it is essential to take time for yourself and not lose yourself in law school. 7. What has been your most memorable law school moment so far? My most memorable law school experience was competing on the Mack Kidd Moot Court Team. Competing on a moot court team was extremely rewarding because of all the months of preparation that went into the competition. I also had terrific coaches that prepared all of us to be on the top of our game when the competition came around. 8. What do you plan to do post-graduation?. After graduation, I plan to practice as a restructuring associate at Vinson & Elkins. I am also exploring the possibility of clerking in a bankruptcy court post-graduation. 9. Have you had any important mentors during law school? If so, who? My closest mentor in law school was my SBA mentor, Marissa Spiwak. Even as a 3L, I talk to Marissa frequently to ask for advice and tell her what I have been up to. I also consider Beth Lee and Mary Beth Nielsen as mentors for all of their help and assistance while I was looking for a job. Even after I secured employment, Beth and Mary Beth have always been available to talk whenever I have questions or need anything. 10. Where do you see yourself in 5 and 10 years? In five to ten years, I see myself practicing as a bankruptcy attorney in Dallas. I would also love to be an active member of both the bar and my community.

Tell us about yourself. My name is Shereen Baig. I was born in Saudi Arabia and immigrated to the United States at the age of eleven. I am of South Asian descent. I grew up in Flint, Michigan and attended undergrad at the University of Michigan, Flint. I am happily married to my absolute favorite human. I am the type of person to fiercely advocate for issues I am passionate about, and always stand up for those who have been unjustly treated-whether it is due to their religion, socioeconomic status, or race. Growing up in Flint has really impacted my outlook on life. Today, more than ever, I recognize the importance of giving opportunities to those who have been impacted by slavery and unjust wars globally. 2. Why did you decide to come to SMU Law? I decided to come to SMU because of the clinics and Association of Public Interest Law. Before I committed to the law school, I attended APIL's yearly auction event and immediately felt a sense of gratitude for the community I was going to be part of! 3. What has been your favorite class and why? My favorite class has been Pre-Trial Advocacy with Professor Luis Zambrano. He is kind, brilliant and so helpful! He really helped me polish my legal writing skills. 4. When you are not in school or studying, what do you do for fun? I love to run/go on strenuous hikes, organize at my local mosque, and explore coffee shops. 5. What extracurricular activities have you enjoyed most and why? (SBA, moot court, etc.) So many! I absolutely love Association of Public Interest Law and all that we stand for. Mock trial is such a challenging but fun experience, I get to meet some amazing people all while developing my litigation skills! And Muslim Law Students Association is an absolute favorite of mine because I not only met some of my closest friends through the organization but also, we get to organize events surrounding important topics affecting the Muslim community in the US and abroad. 6. How has law school challenged you most? Law school has challenged me in many ways. Ultimately, law school has forced me to recognize my mental health should always be my number one priority. In an environment where many find hard to say "no", I have learned saying "no" helps us be the best version of ourselves and allows us to re-assess what truly brings us joy. 7. What has been your most memorable law school moment so far? My judicial externship with Chief Judge Barbara Lynn. Not only is she brilliant and I got to learn so much but also being in her chambers is a unique experience because her clerks and staff are super kind/helpful, and we got to do fun things like host potlucks! 8. What do you plan to do post-graduation? Civil Rights Work/Advocacy. 9. Have you had any important mentors during law school? If so, who? Absolutely! Dean Erika Fadel, Dr. Buckner Inniss, Professor Eric Ruben, Gaby Purdue, and Christina Ta have been instrumental in helping me navigate these past couple of years. Dean Collins and Dean Yeager have been so kind and generous with their time and are truly always here for me whenever I need their support! All of them have continuously reminded me the bigger picture of why pursuing law is beneficial, but more importantly they believed in me during the toughest of times. Additionally, there is a large team of students/professors/friends who have been helpful- I really could not have gotten through these past years without my SMU Law family! 10. Where do you see yourself in 5 and 10 years? I hope I get to partake in meaningful grassroots work where I can first-hand witness change, I am part of. I am a big believer of investing in the people locally to ensure our communities have a better chance at life.

Bush Presidential Center Prospective Students Current Students Alumni Information for Faculty & Staff Apply to SMUGIVE NOW Dedman School of Law Menu Search Admissions Student Profiles Skyler Arbuckle, Class of 2022 Skyler Arbuckle, Class of 2022 1. Tell us about yourself. I'm a 3rd-year student from Houston, TX. I attended Howard University as an undergrad where I played volleyball and majored in Allied Health Sciences. Upon graduation, I thought I wanted to go into healthcare, but I had a swift change of plans after being rejected multiple application cycles from various graduate programs. While mapping out my next steps, I decided to accept a temporary receptionist position at a boutique law firm in Houston named Gibbs & Bruns LLP. I had no prior knowledge about the law, attorneys, or the legal profession. My temporary position as receptionist blossomed into a full-time position as the firm's Recruiting Coordinator where I recruited law students and lateral associates. During my tenure at Gibbs & Bruns, I had an excellent opportunity to work with incredibly talented and accomplished attorneys who inspired me to enter a field I never imagined. I decided to apply to law school and was accepted the first time. The rest, I suppose, is history. 2. Why did you decide to come to SMU Law? I decided to attend to SMU for several reasons. First, I knew I wanted to practice in Texas, and SMU has a history of producing brilliant attorneys. The practical learning opportunities, such as the Corporate Counsel Externship and Federal Judicial Externship programs, and outstanding faculty members, made SMU stood out. Additionally, I had an amazing conversation with Professor Jessica Dixon Weaver before my admission, and she completely sold me on SMU. Second, a large portion of my family lives in Dallas, and I knew it would be paramount to have a strong support system to help me get through the rigors of law school. Third, my family's ties to SMU, Dallas, and Texas are deep and very personal, so, all things considered, SMU was the perfect fit. 3. What has been your favorite class and why? I enjoyed some of my first-year classes the most. Legal Research & Writing was one of my favorite classes as a 1L, and while the course was initially very intimidating, my professor, Dr. Beverly Dureus, made me fall in love with legal writing. She encouraged me throughout the learning process and made a subject that can be difficult to understand and even more difficult to teach enjoyable. I also enjoyed participating in the Federal Judicial Externship course where I had the pleasure of externing with Judge Irma Ramirez. Judge Ramirez is an exceptional judge and even better mentor. She gave me projects that challenged my understanding of legal issues and took time to educate me. For my upper-level courses, I enjoyed Trial Advocacy. My professors, Rachael Jones, Blake Bailey, and Susan Halpern made the class fun. By the end of the class, I walked away with invaluable oral advocacy skills that I know will serve me well in practice. 4. When you are not in school or studying, what do you do for fun? I love to work out! It's an activity I made sure I incorporated into my daily routine before law school, and it is certainly something I'll make sure I make time for even after I begin practicing (shout out to my Contracts professor, Professor Greg Crespi, for demanding we made time during 1L to get daily exercise). I also really enjoy hanging out with my rambunctious schnauzer puppy, Louie, sampling food and wine pairings, and making charcuterie boards. 5. What extracurricular activities have you enjoyed most and why? (SBA, moot court, etc.) I've enjoyed serving as president of the Black Law Students Association (BLSA) to help encourage and provide a community for Black law students at SMU. Oftentimes, Black students enter law school oblivious to the challenges and rigors of law school. BLSA serves as an on-campus support system to help our members reach their full potential in law school and beyond. I also enjoyed serving as a student research assistant to former Senior Associate Dean and University Distinguished Professor, Dean Lolita Buckner Inniss. Dean Inniss is one of the most brilliant people I've ever met and working with her was an incredible experience. Her dedication to scholarship and engaging in critical legal inquiry were nothing short of inspiring. It was an honor to serve as her research assistant. 6. How has law school challenged you most? Law school has challenged me to re-evaluate my expectations of being "perfect." Perfect law students do not exist, and perfect lawyers don’t exist either. I think some of the best lawyers are lawyers who remain resilient when faced with challenges, mistakes, setbacks, and even failure. That same resiliency allows them to see past their shortcomings so they can learn and become better at practicing law. If I want to be regarded as one of the best in this profession (and I do), I must be resilient, and I think building that resiliency starts with letting go of the idea of being perfect and embracing challenges as an opportunity to learn. 7. What has been your most memorable law school moment so far? My most memorable law school moment was my acceptance into law school. I remember I had just gotten off the elevator at work and was headed to my office when I received a phone call from the Dedman Law admissions department informing me that I had been accepted to law school. SMU was the first law school to notify me of my acceptance, and I remember feeling an overwhelming sense of accomplishment, gratitude, and relief that the best was yet to come for me and my journey. 8. What do you plan to do post-graduation? As of now, I have no plans post-graduation. I know, without a doubt, I want to be a litigator. I'd love the opportunity to serve as a term law clerk for the federal judiciary as I enjoyed interning and externing in federal chambers. It was an excellent opportunity to engage with different practice areas while also practically applying legal concepts I learned in law school. For now, I'm committed to remaining flexible until I find a great fit to begin my career post-grad. 9. Have you had any important mentors during law school? If so, who? I have had some incredible mentors during law school who have helped shape and mold me into the lawyer I hope to be. Dedman Law Alumni Vicki Blanton and Jasmine Tobias have motivated me with their words of wisdom and constant reassurance. Jasmine Tobias is incredibly genuine in the way she mentors me, and her encouragement has helped me get through some serious periods of doubt and uncertainty. Vicki Blanton has been such a huge source of support and encouragement as I've matriculated through law school. As her mentee, she stresses the importance of constantly striving to make my best better and seeking mentors who can serve as my confidant, coach, or champion. I'm blessed to say that in Ms. Blanton, I have all three--she's my confidant, my coach, and my champion. Several of professors and faculty have also served as mentors, including Professor Beverly Dureus, Professor Jessica Dixon-Weaver, Dean Lolita Buckner Inniss, and Dean Erika Fadel. Each of these women poured into me throughout my journey here at SMU, and I'm so thankful to have had them in my corner supporting me in all my endeavors. Additionally, Judge Sam Lindsay and Judge Irma Ramirez are my mentors and the admiration and respect I have for each of them cannot be overstated. They are both outstanding members of the judiciary, and it was an honor to intern and extern in their chambers. 10. Where do you see yourself in 5 and 10 years? To be completely transparent--I don't know yet. If someone were to ask me ten years ago where I saw myself in five and ten years, I assure you the answer would not have been in law school on my way to becoming a lawyer (I just knew I was going to be a medical professional). My overarching goal is to excel in whatever I ultimately choose to do. I pride myself on hard work and a commitment to excellence in all I do. If nothing else, I want to meaningfully contribute to the legal field, inspire and encourage others, and leave an indelible mark on the profession.

For the past six years, Austin-based game developer Certain Affinity has supported up-and-coming SMU Guildhall students through teaching, portfolio reviews, career days, and guest lectures, in addition to hiring several alumni. Certain Affinity aims to foster the values of passion, character, leadership and service in future Guildhall students and honor Nels Nelson, a past employee who embodied these values to the fullest, by partnering with SMU Guildhall to create the Certain Affinity Nels Memorial Scholarship. Students will be invited to apply based on their admission submission. Finalists will be reviewed by Certain Affinity and the recipient will be notified in the late Spring. About Nels: Nels Nelson joined the Certain Affinity family in 2013. During his time there as a game and systems designer, Nels always delivered a high level of passion, creativity, knowledge, and professionalism that garnered the admiration and respect of his peers. Nels improved Certain Affinity’s games, teams, and the company as a whole through his positivity, collaboration, and leadership. Nels Charles Nelson was born on January 17, 1975 in Tokyo, Japan. Growing up, Nels was a member of the National Honor Society, played competitive chess, and enjoyed English literature and drama. His love of English literature led Nels to graduate from Cornell University with a B.A. in English. Nels developed his love for computers and programming at a young age. He taught beginner and advanced computer courses during high school and over his winter and summer breaks from college. Nels also started designing computer games at that time, a hobby that he turned into a professional career spanning nearly two decades. Nels’ passion for his work and his heart for service inspired those who worked with him. His knowledge and ability made him a natural leader, and his individual character left a distinct and inspirational mark on Certain Affinity that will continue to guide us well into the future. For this reason, the ideal candidates for this scholarship will exemplify these four traits in their own lives and work: passion, service, leadership, and strength of character Apply to SMU Guildhall SMU Guildhall Game Changers Shaped Here 3100 McFarlin Blvd., Suite 306 Dallas , Texas 75205 (214) 768-4278 © SMU Legal Disclosures Site Index Working at SMU Apply to SMU Guildhall x

Prior knowledge of digital 2D and 3D programs is a definite advantage for what you will be doing, but it is not a requirement. Your portfolio will consist of past examples of art work that showcase your talent. Examples may be digitally based and/or original art executed in traditional media (like drawing, charcoal or clay) to show a variety of subjects and styles. Your submissions will tell us a lot about you as a student and as an artist/illustrator. It will help us determine the degree to which you can look at a reference and accurately recreate it, and your ability to see what is actually there and render it in detail. If you have a portfolio of 2D and 3D art, upload it to our online portfolio site. It is preferred that your portfolio includes 10-20 examples of your past work. You may upload a link to a digital portfolio, or individual files. If you do not have a portfolio, complete and submit the following: Figure poses/life drawings (3) Portraits (4) — include front, side, and three-quarter views, male and female subjects, and one non-human creature Architectural or environment drawings (2) Large animal, such as a horse or large cat (1) Imaginative character concept of your favorite super hero in three-quarter view (1) Imaginative character concept of a unique character for a digital game (1) Drawing of the environment in which the character lives (1) Graphic/commercial art example such as a logo, ad or banner (1) Copyrights and References: You may have been taught that working from photographic reference is to be avoided. That is not the case in our courses. High quality reference (photographic or from life) is essential to the skills you will develop at SMU Guildhall. Composition and presentation always matter, as do well-considered choices regarding value, hue, and chroma in colored works. All that having been said, you must respect the copyrights of others. Do not use copyrighted photographic reference without the permission of the copyright holder (usually the photographer). Do not submit things drawn from the work of other artists. That includes commercial books on sketch techniques. The safest photographic reference is a photo you have taken yourself — and the offer the bonus of allowing you to control the setting, pose, and light. Violation of these rules will result in an unfavorable review of your submission.

If you have a portfolio consisting of the aforementioned design projects, upload it to our online portfolio site. If you do not have past work (don't worry, most applicants do not), successful completion of the following assignments is required. Assignment 1: Using up to five sheets of graph paper (10 units per inch), design and draw the side view of a 2D side-scrolling game level with approximately two minutes of gameplay. All of the following requirements and constraints must be met. If you aren’t familiar with 2D side-scrolling games, refer to Super Mario, Sonic, Contra, or Alien Hominid. Then, write a paragraph describing the objective of the level and how you imagine it being played; including how the timing puzzles and jumping puzzles are to be played. Also include an explanation of the theme you selected for the level and why you chose that theme. Requirements: The level should have a theme that relates to the gameplay. You may select any theme of interest to you for a 2D game concept — indoors, outdoors, underwater, in a dance club, even in outer space. Include a clearly marked path through the level for the player to engage in all the primary gameplay actions. Identify the player starting location and the end of the level. Indicate the player size in grid units. Indicate the adversary size in grid units. Include at least one jumping puzzle in the level. A jumping puzzle may be used to provide a risky way to get to a reward by jumping onto an object, or character. Include at least one timing puzzle in the level. A timing puzzle may be used to challenge the player by requiring mastery of player movement to get through a series of moving obstacles. Include at least six adversaries for the player to encounter in the level. Indicate adversary locations and the paths each adversary follows in the game. Include at least one of each of the following types of pick-up items in your level: Flight for 5 seconds; Invulnerability for 5 seconds; Health +5; Health +10 Start the player with 60 points of health out of a possible 100 points. Include a key/legend for the map. The legend should tell us how to recognize the player and player size, adversaries and adversary size, the different type of pick-up items, and the critical path through the level. Use ink for the final drawing to ensure it is completely legible. Presentation is important! Scan (or recreate digitally) your design and upload all pages. Constraints: The player is unarmed. The adversaries only travel side to side. The normal jump height is equal to the player height. You determine what that is. (We recommend five grid units if you use 10 units per inch paper.) The adversaries reduce the players' health by 20 points on touch unless the player lands on the head of one of the adversaries. Landing on the head of an adversary will result in the player being tossed into the air, a distance equal to twice the player's height. While in the air, the player has directional control. The controls are: left/right arrow keys for direction and the spacebar to jump. To use the flight pick-up the spacebar must be held down. Extra Credit Show alternate paths through the level. Show secret areas. Make us say, "Wow, that's pretty cool." Assignment 2: Create a simple level to demonstrate your technical aptitude with any game engine that you wish, then submit 8-10 screenshots of your level and a text description of the level including your goals and what you learned while creating it. If you have already created a level outside of this assignment, you are welcome to use screenshots from that level to fulfill this requirement. *Please note that we do not expect the level to be polished or full of gameplay.

If you have a portfolio showcasing past code samples, submit 2-5 examples of structured computer code that you have written. Code samples in any structured language will be accepted, though games are preferred. We prefer C++ but will review other languages as well (C#, Java, etc.) C++ skills are critical to success at the Guildhall, and doing your entrance test in C++ will help us verify that you are indeed ready. Each example should be in a self-contained directory and should include code, documentation (indicating intent, scope, input, output, etc.), user guide/instructions, and illustrations of input and output for the program. Include a README text file explaining the contents of your submissions as follows: Your name Directory structure for your code samples Explanation/description of each code sample Date when the code was written You will save these into a .zip file and upload into the "media" section of our online portfolio site. If you do not have a portfolio showcasing your code, you must complete the following assignments: Assignment 1: Create a Resource Manager for a Real Time Strategy (RTS) game. Your program manages a "directed graph" (a system of nodes and links between them going in one direction, much like web pages and their links). On startup, your program reads a file "resource.txt" (from the current directory) which describes resources and the resources they depend on. The file resource.txt could, for example, contain (exactly 4 lines): handgun bullets bullets ore bombs ore turret bullets The first line says that there is a link from a node called "handgun" to a node called 'bullet". This means for a handgun to be a useable, it relies on the resource bullets. Requirements: Your program should work with any amount of nodes and any amount of links between them (your program may be tested with a larger resource.txt made by SMU Guildhall faculty). To this end, you should represent nodes with a Node class, and the set of links for a single node using an STL container of your choice. Your program should loop and display two items on the screen: (1) a current view of the graph, and (2) a list of each node and whether it is usable or not. For any current node, if any of the nodes it relies on get deleted that node becomes unusable. Your program should handle two types of input. A user should be allowed to delete a node and quit at any time. If using a console program, input should be "q" for quit, or the name of a node to delete it. When you delete a node, make sure any links to it are deleted correctly too. Be certain to have correct memory management for these operations ensuring no memory leaks when the program exits.

We look for an art background that is grounded in traditional mediums: drawing, painting, sculpting, etc. You should be comfortable with observational and life drawing. While in college, take courses that will lead to a degree such as a Bachelor's of Fine Arts (BFA). Resources: Autodesk Education Community — One-stop source for student learning versions of 3DStudio Max, Maya, and Mudbox with helpful forums, program support, inspiration, and reference. Unity 2D and 3D Game Engine — Downloadable version of the latest Unity engine with support, tutorials, and access to everything needed to dip your feet into one of the easiest to learn editors out there. Feel free to make an account, you’ll need one when classes start. Unreal 4 Editor — Physics based rendering and integration with Substance Painter and Designer allow you to render your game art in stunning clarity and realism. More complex than Unity, but offers forums, video tutorials and a support base that make it approachable. Adobe Photoshop — The most popular concept and texture creation tool. Free trial, tutorials, and support are available. ArtStation — Where all game, concept, entertainment artists seem to archive their work, this is the place to see where commercial art is at now and will be in the future. Incredible resource for inspiration as well as custom Photoshop brushes, 3D materials, and process videos. Polycount Forums — Great repository of game art with references, tutorials, and critiques. A central location for new game artists to network and grow with a decent community to bounce their work off of for feedback. Sketchfab — One of the best web-based 3D content viewers. Allows you to upload your own work for critique and see 3D art up close. Great for uncovering creation secrets, getting inspiration, and process investigation. Integrates with 3DStudio Max via a simple plugin. Marmoset Toolbag — The best realtime 3D art viewer out there. Supports PBR (physics-based rendering), has an available native Unreal 4 shader, and offers tutorials, support, and a gallery of incredible sample art. Episcura Photo Reference — A great go-to site for free photographs to use as part of a photorealistic material or as real-world references of architecture, nature, animals, vehicles, etc. YouTube — Good source for video tutorials for any and all tools we use to create game art, like Unity, Photoshop, Unreal, 3DStudio Max, Maya, Mudbox, and Zbrush — most in multiple languages! The first place you should go for time-sensitive support. If something isn’t work correctly, you can be sure others are having the same issues, and some of them have created videos on how to solve the problem. Subscribing to the Autodesk, Unity, Unreal, and Photoshop official channels is a must! Pixologic Zbrush — Excellent 3D sculpting tool similar to Autodesk’s Mudbox. Offers a trial version, tutorials, support, reference, and samples of detailed sculpts and uses for Zbrush. DeviantArt — Hit or miss as far as content goes... Some great art, and some questionable work as well. That said, this is still the best source for custom Photoshop brushes, swatches, and other presets that can make your Photoshop experience even more enjoyable. Great tutorials for concept artists as well.

Our curriculum provides a great deal of intermediate and advanced C++ guidance and practice, but doesn't teach the language from scratch. You will have a much easier time absorbing all of this if you are already comfortable with C++ to begin with. If you have yet to choose your college, find one whose computer science curriculum includes plenty of C++ based classes. If you've already started college or don't have the luxury of choice, try to do as many classes and/or independent projects where you can use C++. In the end, it doesn't matter which course, book, or project you embark on, as long as it provides ample exposure to learn the language and gain experience in constructing larger programs, and wrestling with the issues that brings. The larger the project, and the more complex data structures it involves, the better. If you come to C++ from Java, make sure you embrace its more low-level nature and get intimate with memory allocation, memory layout, pointers etc. Failure to do so can make life very hard when progressing through the more complicated topics of the Guildhall program later on. Conversely, if you come to C++ from C, try to embrace the power of thinking and coding at a higher level while remaining mindful of what’s actually happening “under the hood”. In addition to writing your own code, we also highly recommend reading others’ code. With Open Source, plenty of C++ code is out there for your reading pleasure. Pick a project, get its source to compile, and make an effort to see how it works internally. Place breakpoints, step through it in the debugger, and see what it does. Tinker around to modify or extend its behavior. Resources: The C++ Programming Language: Special Edition (3rd Edition) — The most thorough reference, written by the designer of the language. It's not exactly an easy book to use in learning the language from scratch, so you may want to accompany it with a more tutorial-style book. Memory as a Programming Concept in C and C++ — For those who feel they have weak experience with C++'s low-level nature. The C++ FAQ — Provides an excellent coverage of the topics and tensions within C++. You may or may not agree with everything in the FAQ, but you will become a far stronger C++ programmer by reading and considering its contents.

From Move-In Day hustle and bustle and game-day Boulevarding to the Celebration of Lights cheer and Commencement excitement, milestones throughout the year are marked with unforgettable special festivities. From your first Family Weekend to your 50th Homecoming game, you’ll never stop being a Mustang. Motto The SMU motto is veritas liberabit vos, or, “The truth will make you free.” Chosen by SMU’s first president, the motto was adopted in 1912. It’s featured all across campus, including in the official SMU seal cast into the rotunda floor of SMU’s first building, Dallas Hall. Alma Mater Written by an SMU theology student in 1916 and set to words by SMU’s first band director in 1929, “Varsity” has been proudly sung at University events from Opening Convocation to Commencement to sporting events ever since. School Colors SMU’s official school colors are red and blue. Live Mascot SMU’s live mascot, Peruna IX, is a miniature Shetland pony named after an early 20th-century medicine, Peruna Tonic – which was said to have a kick. Mustang fans show school pride with pony ears during school songs, chants and cheers. Learn about the history of the nine Perunas here. Pony Ears We use our “pony ears” hand symbol for pretty much all occasions – when posing for a photo, cheering on the Mustangs or singing our school songs. To make them, start with a peace sign and let your first and middle fingers “relax” so that they’re slightly bent. If you’re singing the fight song, rock your hand back and forth with the music. When you find yourself on campus, bring your pony ears, too! Homecoming Every fall, the Mustang community gathers on the Hilltop to celebrate Homecoming. Students compete through their organizations in a variety of activities to win the day, alumni gather from across the street or around the globe to reconnect at reunion parties, families from surrounding neighborhoods come to watch the Homecoming parade, and all are encouraged to cheer on the ’stangs at Ford Stadium! The Boulevard At SMU, we like to say that we don’t tailgate – we Boulevard. Before home football games, you’ll find students, alumni and Mustang fans socializing up and down Bishop Boulevard. One alumna, Palmer Beldy ’22, shares her top tips for a successful Boulevard. The Hilltop More than a century ago, when our founders set out to find the place to lay the cornerstone of Dallas Hall, they chose the highest point on campus, from where you could look out upon the beautiful city of Dallas toward downtown and the prosperous future that was to come. From there, the nickname "the Hilltop" was born, and it’s the name by which we still refer to our tree-lined, 234-acre campus in the heart of one of the nation’s economic and cultural powerhouses. Events PerunaPalooza | SMU’s springtime festival celebrating Peruna’s birthday. Students enjoy games, rides and activities while helping themselves to a variety of carnival-inspired free food. Pigskin Revue | During Homecoming Weekend, Mustangs take part in our longest running tradition, the Pigskin Revue. Started in 1933, this variety show features acts from groups across the community – students, faculty and alumni. The Mustang Band is heavily featured as participants sing, dance and even take part in some stand-up comedy. Celebration of Lights | SMU and the surrounding communities gather for this joyous occasion to watch the famous Dallas Hall light up with thousands of lights. Guests gather on the Dallas Hall lawn for hot cocoa, cider and warm cookies and to hear holiday carols performed by SMU students. After SMU President R. Gerald Turner reads the Christmas Story, the special evening concludes with the singing of Silent Night and the lighting of SMU’s stunning Dallas Hall and surrounding trees. Tate Lecture Series | The lecture series brings to campus some of the world's most interesting and provocative speakers, including former presidents, commentators, futurists and artistic legends. The Tate Lecture Series annually returns almost $1 million in student scholarships to the University.

The United States government requires all international applicants to provide proof of ability to pay tuition and living expenses before SMU can issue the forms required to obtain a visa. This requirement applies both to international students coming from abroad and those transferring from another U.S. university or institution. For SMU to issue you a Form I-20, you will need to submit: 1. The International Student Financial Statement form. Section one and section two must be completed, including the signatures of both you (the student) and your sponsor. 2. A copy of the picture page from your passport 3. Original Financial Verification from Bank or Financial Institution, on bank letterhead, from you or your sponsor, must be dated within six months of the time of I-20 issuance. Account balance(s) must be shown in an amount greater than or equal to the total estimated costs below. - Any scholarship amount awarded by SMU can be submitted as part of the financial support documents. An example of the wording that can be used follows: “I hereby certify that according to our records, SPONSOR’S NAME, the sponsor of STUDENT’S NAME, is capable of meeting the $90,152 education expenses of the student as indicated on the Estimated Undergraduate Cost form." The bank letter must be translated into English and current balance in U.S. dollars. 4. If you are currently attending an institution in the US (college or high school), you will need to arrange for the release of your SEVIS record to SMU once your program is completed. Please complete our Transfer-In Form and upload it within the International Document Submission Form found on your Admission Status Page. The SMU International Student & Scholar Service Office will process your I-20 request after all required materials have been submitted to the SMU Office of Undergraduate Admission. Please expect approximately two weeks after your documents have been received for your Form I-20 to be processed. A digital copy of your Form I-20 will be e-mailed to you so you can make your visa appointments at the US Embassy near you. Estimated Undergraduate Costs The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) requires that all foreign passport holders planning to study in the United States verify that appropriate funds are available to pay for education, living, and other expenses. This verification is needed in order to process and issue the required I-20 document.

The Admission Committee will focus on your college coursework and transferable GPA for admission. The Committee finds that students with a 2.70 transferable GPA or higher are the most competitive for admission. In the admission process for transfer students, we evaluate both the rigor of the college courses you've taken and the readiness for your intended major. We recommend taking all or some of the prerequisite courses for your intended major before transferring to SMU. All transfer students are required to complete college algebra or a college-level math course before transferring to SMU. If algebra I, geometry and algebra II were taken in high school and graduation was less than three years ago, this requirement is waived. We recommend that all transfer students complete an English composition course, a lab science course, a math course beyond college algebra and at least one course in your intended major before transferring. Close × First-Year Transfer Students First-year transfer students are those students who have fewer than 30 transferable hours or who have graduated from high school within the last calendar year. If three or more years have passed since your high school graduation, we highly recommend that you acquire 30 or more transferable hours before you transfer. All first-year transfer students will be automatically considered for first year academic-based scholarshipsbased on your high school academic performance, including high school GPA, curriculum, and SAT or ACT test score. In order to qualify for transfer scholarships you must complete at least half of the 50-hour requirement after your high school graduation. In addition to evaluating your college course work and transferable GPA, the Admission Committee will also review your high school curriculum, high school GPA and standardized test scores. Your official test scores will need to be submitted directly from College Board or the ACT unless they are reported on your official high school transcript. The Admission Committee can begin review of your application after receiving all official college transcripts, but may not be able to make a final admission decision until your high school transcript and test scores have been received. All transfer students are required to complete college algebra or a college-level math course before transferring to SMU. If algebra I, geometry and algebra II were taken in high school and graduation was less than three years ago, this requirement is waived.

Bush Presidential Center Prospective Students Current Students Alumni Information for Faculty & Staff Apply to SMUGIVE NOW Meadows School of the Arts Areas of Study Admissions About Menu Search Art Undergraduate Studies Admissions Admissions Admissions Portfolio Review Sessions for High School or Transfer Students Schedule a Visit Meadows Art Application, Admission and Portfolio If you are interested in applying to the SMU Meadows Division of Art, please read the following information, then start your application by clicking the button at the bottom of the page. In order to pursue a BFA or BA in Art at SMU, applicants must be admitted to both the Meadows School of the Arts as well as to SMU, and must also submit a portfolio to Meadows via the Meadows Art Application. It is recommended that applicants apply to SMU and to Meadows at the same time. Read more about the portfolio and how to access the Meadows Art Application below. The Portfolio All students applying for study in the Division of Art for the BFA or BA art degree programs must submit a digital portfolio within the Meadows Art application. (The Meadows Art Application portal is found further below). Include 15 to 20 works. The works can be from direct observation and your imagination; work that shows your experience with different media; and work that demonstrates both your skills and interests. This should include work based in school assignments as well as work done on your own. Submitted art portfolios are automatically considered for Meadows artistic scholarship. Note that within the Meadows Art application you will be asked to provide additional information about the artwork and answers to questions such as: With what media are you comfortable? What media would you like to explore? This includes both traditional media as well as experimental and digital media. How do you see that exploration as important to your study? Tell us something about one of your works in this portfolio. Why is it important to you? What were the obstacles you encountered working on this project? What inspired it? Is it an individual investigation, a response to an assignment, a work within a larger series? Why are you interested in the study of art, in general and at SMU? Do you have any specific interests you’d like to explore? Is there something specific about our program at Meadows that will aid that exploration? Portfolio and Application Deadlines The art portfolio is submitted within the Meadows Art Application. Submission deadlines are the same as the SMU application deadlines: November 1 - Early Action, Early Decision I, and Spring Transfers February 1 - Regular Decision and Early Decision II April 1 - Fall Transfers We strongly recommend applicants submit their SMU application and their Meadows Art Application within the same semester. After faculty have reviewed all portfolios, applicants will receive an email from Meadows regarding its admission decision; approximately two weeks later, applicants will hear from SMU regarding its SMU admission decision. Early Action versus Early Decision application: Early Decision is a binding agreement to attend SMU if you are accepted to the university, even if you are not also accepted to the Meadows Art Division. For those who wish to apply by the November 1 “Early” deadline, we recommend that art applicants select “Early Action” instead of “Early Decision.” By applying Early Action, art applicants can keep their options open while expressing strong interest in SMU.

Bush Presidential Center Prospective Students Current Students Alumni Information for Faculty & Staff Apply to SMUGIVE NOW Meadows School of the Arts Areas of Study Admissions About Menu Search Undergraduate Studies Admissions Dance Admission FAQs Dance Admission FAQs Admissions Dance Admission FAQs For more details such as audition agenda, audition dates, etc., be sure to see the Meadows Dance Application, Admission and Audition page. Auditions on campus or in regional cities When should I register for my audition? As soon as you can. There are a limited number of slots open for auditions. Remember that you must first submit your Meadows Dance Application in order to then register for an audition. Check the Meadows Dance Application, Admission and Audition webpage for deadlines for on-campus, and regional auditions. I can’t make the audition date I signed up for after all. Can I sign up for a different date? Maybe. It depends on whether any slots are left in the other auditions. Contact Meadows Admission to reschedule or switch your audition type to a recorded audition: meadowsadmission@smu.edu / 214-768-3217. If there are no other openings, you can send in a recorded audition. What should I wear? Auditionees should wear dancewear that does not impede movement of the body and that is form-fitting so that the faculty adjudicators can see alignment and movement particularities. We suggest full-length, non-footed tights and form-fitting tops or leotards. No loose-fitting t-shirts, baggy pants, or shorts. What kind of dance shoes should I wear? You should bring both jazz shoes and ballet slippers. Auditionees will dance in bare feet for the modern portion of the audition. Pointe shoes are required only if they are needed for the solo. Can I wear a facemask during the audition? Yes. Zoom auditions: Do you have any advice on how to set up our devices for the Zoom audition? Mounting your cellphone, tablet, or laptop to a tripod – or setting your device on a flat, steady surface – is best to avoid a shaky image. Most of our dance applicants set their laptop as a wide shot that covers most of the studio area, but before the audition starts make sure you can be easily seen in the image – head-to-toe – as you dance across the floor, and that your image of you isn’t tiny and hard to see on the screen. If I want to pursue the Dance minor, do I still need to audition? Yes. Those interested in the Dance minor register for the audition within their Meadows Dance Application. Is there a difference in the audition and application process for the major and the minor? No, the process is the same. Dance applicants must complete the Meadows Dance Application, and must audition. The Solo Do all applicants perform their solo? No. All applicants should prepare a 90-120 second solo in their choice of ballet, modern, or jazz technique and must provide music either on a cellphone, computer, or USB drive. Solos are performed at the request of the faculty following the morning audition technique classes. Auditionees will be dismissed if they are not asked to perform their solo. If the applicant is instead auditioning via recorded audition, the solo is required to be included in their audition video. If my solo is ballet, must it be classical or can it be contemporary? It can be either classical or contemporary, your choice. (Jazz solos and modern solos are also accepted.) Could the solo be a ballet variation or can it be a combination of ballet, modern, and/or jazz? Yes. However, typically students focus on one style with a clear point of view. What if my solo is longer than 2 minutes? The time length requirement for the solo is 90 to 120 seconds - a minute and a half at least, or up to but not exceeding two minutes. It’s okay for the music to fade out if the song is longer than two minutes. Get creative and choreograph a solo that meets the requirements. You’ve got this! Recorded solo: Is it okay if I submit a video of a solo performance I did on stage last year, or would you prefer I record a new video of me performing at a studio? New or recent is preferred, whether you are solo onstage, in a studio, in your back yard, at your school’s gymnasium, etc. If you still want to send in a video from a solo you recently performed, select the best 90-to-120 seconds of the solo and upload that excerpt via your Meadows Dance Application portal, “Media/portfolio” section. Videos are uploaded via the Meadows Dance Application online. The Interview This pertains to all types of auditions, live or recorded. If you are asked to perform your solo, that means the faculty wants to further consider you for possible admission to the program. Do you have any tips for doing audition interviews? First, relax and let them see who you are as a person and as an artist. The faculty want to know more about you, your perspectives on dance, what your goals are, etc. You may be asked a variety of questions, or may be asked to perform a technique or combination. In any case, take a breath, relax and enjoy the chat! Recorded audition interview If you have sent in a recorded audition, you may later receive an email from Meadows asking for an interview. It means the faculty want to further consider you for possible admission to the program. You might also not receive a request, and that’s fine. Students are admitted with and without a follow up interview from a recorded audition. Interviews can be either in person, or via Zoom. Location, date and time of the interview are at the discretion of the faculty. The Application, Résumé and Headshot Is the photo for the Meadows Dance Application required to be a headshot? Good question! Headshot please, face forward. Medium or closeup is fine. Should the résumé be my jobs and activities, or just dance experience? Just dance experience. Typically, applicants provide info such as training, what technique(s) they’ve studied, dance studio or club and/or instructor they’ve trained with, and what years these activities took place. Many provide a list of performances and in which years; other dance experience; choreography experience; dance awards and honors. Is there a word limit for the questions in the Meadows Dance Application? Although there is no word limit, the faculty is not looking for an essay. One paragraph is fine, or two or three if you need it. Can you explain the thing about submitting both your SMU application and your Meadows application & audition in the same semester please? Sure! The Dance degree has a “dual admission” process, and it takes time to complete the process: Applicant applies to SMU and to Meadows using two separate applications – one for SMU, the other for Meadows. Applicant registers for their audition via the online Meadows Dance Application. After the audition, the applicant will hear from Meadows whether or not the applicant has been accepted into the Dance program. This notification will be via email, and is usually sent to the applicant about two weeks after the audition. Meadows informs the SMU Office of Undergraduate Admission of its Dance admission decision. After hearing from Meadows, SMU will then render its admission decision and will contact the applicant via email. It tends to be easier on the applicants and their families if they can get their decisions from Meadows and from SMU in the same semester. The main caveat is if a student applies to SMU in the fall as, for example, Early Action, but waits till the spring to audition, they won’t get their Meadows admission decision until about two weeks after their audition in the spring, and their SMU decision will follow about two weeks after Meadows’ decision. For some applicants that’s fine, they’re in no hurry; but other applicants want to know their admission decisions sooner. When will I hear if I am accepted to the Dance program or not? If you audition either in person, you will receive your Meadows admission decision about two weeks after the audition. Note that your SMU admission decision will follow about two weeks after your Meadows Decision. If you submit a recorded audition, you’ll receive your Meadows decision about three weeks after the submission deadline: Applying Early Action or Early Decision I: November 15 Applying Regular Decision or Early Decision II: January 15 If I want to apply to SMU early, should I apply Early Action or Early Decision I? For dancers, Early Action. Here’s why: Early Decision is a binding agreement to attend SMU if you are accepted to the university even if you are not also accepted to the Meadows Dance Division. For those who wish to apply by the November 1 “Early” deadline, we recommend that dance applicants select “Early Action” instead of “Early Decision.” By applying Early Action, dance applicants can keep their options open while expressing strong interest in SMU. If I apply Regular Decision or Early Decision II, will that hurt my chances of being accepted to the Dance program? Not at all! Know that Meadows considers all of the auditions, whether you audition in the fall or spring semester. We want you to apply and audition when you think you will be at your best. Regular and Early Decision II applications to SMU are due Jan. 15. What if I am admitted to SMU but not to the Dance program? That does sometimes happen, and is the main reason why we encourage early applicants to apply to SMU as Early Action and not Early Decision. If you are accepted to SMU but not to the Dance program, you and your family will need to decide whether you go to SMU and pursue a major other than Dance, or select a different university. Okay, but what if I am admitted to Dance but not to SMU? In order to attend SMU and pursue the BFA in Dance Performance degree, applicants must apply to and be admitted to both SMU and to Meadows School of the Arts Division of Dance. If you are admitted to Dance but not to SMU, you’ll need to select a different university. If I don’t pass my audition, can I audition a second time? Yes. You will need to submit a second Meadows Dance Application and schedule a second audition. Please know that we do not provide feedback on auditions. How many dancers are usually accepted every year? Over 300 dancers apply each year. Approximately 50 are accepted, and of that group, we are looking to form an incoming cohort of 20 to 24 dancers. Any tips on increasing my chances of being admitted to SMU? High grades, activity in your school, community, place of worship, etc. Keep in touch with your SMU admission counselor; attend some SMU or Meadows events (keep checking your email for event announcements and registrations) and show your active interest in SMU. Tell Me More ... Minor in Dance: Can Dance minors perform in the mainstage shows? Casting in the mainstage shows are for Dance majors only. However, on occasion, some minors may be cast in the annual Student Choreography Showcase and/or Senior Dance Concert.

Music Audition FAQs - Meadows School of the Arts, SMU Skip to main content SMU Explore SMU Academics Undergraduate Admission Student Affairs About SMU News Athletics Events Calendar George W. Bush Presidential Center Prospective Students Current Students Alumni Information for Faculty & Staff Apply to SMUGIVE NOW Meadows School of the Arts Areas of Study Admissions About Menu Search Undergraduate Studies Admissions Music Audition FAQs Music Audition FAQs Admissions Audition Requirements Music Audition FAQs Group Visits Meadows Young Artist Program Admissions How early should I register for my audition? Since auditions/interviews are offered on a first-come, first-served basis, we recommend registering for an audition at least 4-6 weeks in advance of your preferred audition date. Audition registration closes once audition slots have filled or one week prior to the audition, whichever comes first. Audition registration is available starting in September. Is there a pre-screen video required? Voice is the only area that requires a pre-screening video. Voice applicants interested in auditioning live for faculty (on-campus or virtual) are required to submit a pre-screen video by Nov. 1 if applying to SMU as Early Action or Early Decision, or by Dec. 1 if applying to SMU as Regular Decision or Early Decision II. Applicants will receive their pre-screening results within 2 weeks of the submission deadline. Audition registration instructions will be sent to voice applicants who successfully pass the pre-screen. I live far away/I can’t attend a live audition date: can I submit a recording instead? We do allow applicants to submit a recorded audition in lieu of a live audition. If you’re not able to attend a live audition date, we highly recommend that you visit campus and have a sample lesson with our faculty at another time. This is for your benefit so that way you can see our campus, meet our faculty, and meet our students. How should I prepare my pre-screen or recorded audition videos? Video recordings should clearly show you performing on your instrument. Recordings should be unedited, and without reverb. If an accompanist is required, please ensure that the accompaniment does not drown out your singing or playing. Do I need to have an accompanist? Accompanists are required for vocal auditions. Accompanists are provided at no charge to vocalists who are auditioning live on campus. Vocalists should bring their scores with them to the audition. Vocalists will not have time to rehearse with their accompanist prior to their audition. If you plan on providing your own accompanist, please email meadowsadmission@smu.edu at least two weeks prior to your audition. How do I prepare the scores for my vocal audition? Scores need to be clearly marked with metronome markings and any variations that are not indicated on the original score, such as unobvious breaths, etc. Please present your sheet music in a notebook. Loose pieces of music are unacceptable, as are original scores that do not stay open for the accompanist. Avoid plastic sleeves and please take great care while copying any music not to cut off any notes or distort the copy ratio to an illegible size. Pages should be double-sided to avoid numerous page turns for your accompanist. There will not be time to rehearse with the pianist prior to the audition. At the audition, you will present your pieces to the accompanist and stand in the curved portion of the piano. How long will my audition last? Most undergraduate auditions will last anywhere from 10 – 20 minutes. When will I hear back about my audition result? Students who audition by/on December 1 will receive their audition results by mid-December. Students who audition in January or February will receive their audition results by early March. Please note that in some smaller studios we may need to wait to finalize admission decisions until after all auditions have concluded in late February. Will I be able to speak with a faculty member at my audition? You will meet a faculty member during your audition and/or interview. There will be an opportunity for you to ask a few questions during your audition. However, we encourage all applicants to reach out to our faculty in advance to arrange a sample lesson. Many of our faculty are offering virtual sample lessons over Zoom or FaceTime. To arrange a sample lesson with faculty please email the faculty directly. Please request a lesson at least two weeks in advance. What is the teacher request form? The teacher request form is where you can share your Meadows music teacher preference for applied lessons. This teacher request form has no bearing on our admission or scholarship decision; it is used only to designate a faculty member as your primary contact. You should, however, feel free to contact any member of the faculty with questions about our programs. We consider your teacher request carefully but cannot guarantee a teacher assignment due to the necessity of balancing faculty loads. Will recorded audition submissions be considered for artistic scholarship? Yes! All music audition types (on-campus or recorded) are equally considered for artistic scholarship. Can I be eligible for an artistic scholarship as a music minor? No. Only music majors are eligible for artistic scholarship. Is there a separate application for consideration of artistic scholarship? There is no separate application for Meadows artistic scholarships, fellowships, funding, etc. All undergraduate applicants are automatically considered for scholarships and funding opportunities through your application and audition. Read more about Meadows scholarships and financial aid. When can I expect to hear about any scholarship and funding opportunities? We do not award any artistic scholarships until after we have concluded all of our auditions for the year. We begin to release scholarship decisions in mid to late March.

Bush Presidential Center Prospective Students Current Students Alumni Information for Faculty & Staff Apply to SMUGIVE NOW Meadows School of the Arts Areas of Study Admissions About Menu Search Undergraduate Studies Admissions Meadows Young Artist Program Meadows Young Artist Program Admissions Audition Requirements Music Audition FAQs Group Visits Meadows Young Artist Program The Meadows Young Artist Program is a new program targeted to exceptional violin, viola, cello and piano players who are currently juniors or seniors in high school. The program is led by internationally acclaimed concert violinist, recording artist and Meadows School of the Arts faculty member Chad Hoopes, winner of the Yehudi Menuhin International Violin Competition and member of the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center. While being immersed in the music program at SMU, these young artists will earn college credit. Participants will take lessons with Meadows School of the Arts music faculty, as well as classes in music theory, musicianship, music history, orchestra and chamber music each semester. They may be enrolled in the Young Artist Program for one or two years and will receive college credit from SMU: seven credits per semester, with a maximum of four semesters. This credit can be applied toward a Bachelor of Music or Bachelor of Arts degree at SMU or transferred to another university. Interested students must simultaneously audition in Meadows and apply for concurrent enrollment. Admission to both Meadows and the concurrent enrollment program are required. The Young Artist Program is selective and will be limited to a maximum of 10 students. For more information, please contact Chad Hoopes, choopes@smu.edu. HOW TO APPLY Audition information: Students can audition for the Young Artist Program through the Meadows Division of Music via the main SMU admission page: https://admission.smu.edu/apply. Audition requirements for each instrument are listed here. Music theory and musicianship testing are included in the audition process, in addition to placement exams for those accepted. FAQs for auditioning Concurrent enrollment information: https://www.smu.edu/simmons/Academics/Concurrent-Enrollment Note: Concurrent enrollment is not the same as dual credit. Concurrent enrollment classes do not replace regular enrollment in another school; instead, they are separate credits alongside a student’s credits in high school. Tuition: Young Artist classes are provided at the reduced rate of $760 per credit hour, totaling $5320 per semester. Scholarships are currently not available. Housing: Students live with their parents or guardian off-campus; no on-campus housing is available. Attendance: Students must enroll in all Young Artist classes offered each semester, and a student’s high school or dual credit community college schedule must work around the SMU class schedule.

Music Audition FAQs - Meadows School of the Arts, SMU Skip to main content SMU Explore SMU Academics Undergraduate Admission Student Affairs About SMU News Athletics Events Calendar George W. Bush Presidential Center Prospective Students Current Students Alumni Information for Faculty & Staff Apply to SMUGIVE NOW Meadows School of the Arts Areas of Study Admissions About Menu Search Undergraduate Studies Admissions Music Audition FAQs Music Audition FAQs Admissions Audition Requirements Music Audition FAQs Group Visits Meadows Young Artist Program Admissions How early should I register for my audition? Since auditions/interviews are offered on a first-come, first-served basis, we recommend registering for an audition at least 4-6 weeks in advance of your preferred audition date. Audition registration closes once audition slots have filled or one week prior to the audition, whichever comes first. Audition registration is available starting in September. Is there a pre-screen video required? Voice is the only area that requires a pre-screening video. Voice applicants interested in auditioning live for faculty (on-campus or virtual) are required to submit a pre-screen video by Nov. 1 if applying to SMU as Early Action or Early Decision, or by Dec. 1 if applying to SMU as Regular Decision or Early Decision II. Applicants will receive their pre-screening results within 2 weeks of the submission deadline. Audition registration instructions will be sent to voice applicants who successfully pass the pre-screen. I live far away/I can’t attend a live audition date: can I submit a recording instead? We do allow applicants to submit a recorded audition in lieu of a live audition. If you’re not able to attend a live audition date, we highly recommend that you visit campus and have a sample lesson with our faculty at another time. This is for your benefit so that way you can see our campus, meet our faculty, and meet our students. How should I prepare my pre-screen or recorded audition videos? Video recordings should clearly show you performing on your instrument. Recordings should be unedited, and without reverb. If an accompanist is required, please ensure that the accompaniment does not drown out your singing or playing. Do I need to have an accompanist? Accompanists are required for vocal auditions. Accompanists are provided at no charge to vocalists who are auditioning live on campus. Vocalists should bring their scores with them to the audition. Vocalists will not have time to rehearse with their accompanist prior to their audition. If you plan on providing your own accompanist, please email meadowsadmission@smu.edu at least two weeks prior to your audition. How do I prepare the scores for my vocal audition? Scores need to be clearly marked with metronome markings and any variations that are not indicated on the original score, such as unobvious breaths, etc. Please present your sheet music in a notebook. Loose pieces of music are unacceptable, as are original scores that do not stay open for the accompanist. Avoid plastic sleeves and please take great care while copying any music not to cut off any notes or distort the copy ratio to an illegible size. Pages should be double-sided to avoid numerous page turns for your accompanist. There will not be time to rehearse with the pianist prior to the audition. At the audition, you will present your pieces to the accompanist and stand in the curved portion of the piano. How long will my audition last? Most undergraduate auditions will last anywhere from 10 – 20 minutes. When will I hear back about my audition result? Students who audition by/on December 1 will receive their audition results by mid-December. Students who audition in January or February will receive their audition results by early March. Please note that in some smaller studios we may need to wait to finalize admission decisions until after all auditions have concluded in late February. Will I be able to speak with a faculty member at my audition? You will meet a faculty member during your audition and/or interview. There will be an opportunity for you to ask a few questions during your audition. However, we encourage all applicants to reach out to our faculty in advance to arrange a sample lesson. Many of our faculty are offering virtual sample lessons over Zoom or FaceTime. To arrange a sample lesson with faculty please email the faculty directly. Please request a lesson at least two weeks in advance. What is the teacher request form? The teacher request form is where you can share your Meadows music teacher preference for applied lessons. This teacher request form has no bearing on our admission or scholarship decision; it is used only to designate a faculty member as your primary contact. You should, however, feel free to contact any member of the faculty with questions about our programs. We consider your teacher request carefully but cannot guarantee a teacher assignment due to the necessity of balancing faculty loads. Will recorded audition submissions be considered for artistic scholarship? Yes! All music audition types (on-campus or recorded) are equally considered for artistic scholarship. Can I be eligible for an artistic scholarship as a music minor? No. Only music majors are eligible for artistic scholarship. Is there a separate application for consideration of artistic scholarship? There is no separate application for Meadows artistic scholarships, fellowships, funding, etc. All undergraduate applicants are automatically considered for scholarships and funding opportunities through your application and audition. Read more about Meadows scholarships and financial aid. When can I expect to hear about any scholarship and funding opportunities? We do not award any artistic scholarships until after we have concluded all of our auditions for the year. We begin to release scholarship decisions in mid to late March. Please be sure to submit your FAFSA and CSS Profile to SMU as soon as possible. You will not hear about any artistic scholarship offers until the Financial Aid office has processed your FAFSA and CSS Profile forms. If you do not plan on submitting the FAFSA or CSS Profile for need-based financial aid consideration, you must submit the Meadows FAFSA/CSS Waiver Form.

Theatre Admission FAQs - Meadows School of the Arts, SMU Skip to main content SMU Explore SMU Academics Undergraduate Admission Student Affairs About SMU News Athletics Events Calendar George W. Bush Presidential Center Prospective Students Current Students Alumni Information for Faculty & Staff Apply to SMUGIVE NOW Meadows School of the Arts Areas of Study Admissions About Menu Search Undergraduate Studies Admissions Theatre Admission FAQs Theatre Admission FAQs Admissions Theatre Admission FAQs Auditions My strength is in classical work. Can I perform classical monologues instead of contemporary monologues? No. However, the faculty might allow you to perform a classical work in addition to the two contemporary monologues. It's fine to mention to the faculty that your strength is in classical, and that information would be of interest to the faculty as they interview you, but it doesn’t guarantee that you would be asked to perform a short classical monologue. It doesn’t hurt to have one at the ready, but whether or not you are asked to perform it is up to faculty discretion. For our monologues, should we stick strictly to our gender and age? Or can we branch out a bit? It’s best to stick to a character who is approximately your age. It’s okay to branch out a bit if it feels genuine to you, but beware, don’t branch out too far and go for a 70-year-old character or a character whose culture or life experiences you know little about, etc. Be sure you can embody the character. For the singing part of the audition, do I need to provide accompaniment? No. The song should be sung a cappella: without musical accompaniment. For the singing part of the audition, what kind of songs are you looking for? The kind you are most confident in and can convey well. We hear all kinds of genres during auditions. Figure out what song you can best convey as an actor, and go for it. 16 bars are all that are needed. But I’m not a good singer! What advice do you have for me to do well during the 16-bar a cappella part? Don’t worry, we’re not looking for the next Beyoncé. We’re looking at breath control, projection and the way you convey the song. Pick a song that feels right for you, and go for it. How can we show our interest in producing, directing or playwriting during an audition? Three ways: On your Meadows Theatre application, indicate Theatre Studies as your preferred theatre specialization. Upload a portfolio or supplemental materials to your Meadows Theatre Application, in the “Media/Portfolio” section; this option is encouraged but not required for those interested in the Theatre Studies track. When you introduce yourself at the beginning of the audition, let the faculty know you are primarily interested in producing, directing, or playwrighting, then go on to give a great audition. After you’ve done your two contemporary monologues and sung 16 bars a cappella, faculty will interview you and more than likely will ask you about your ambitions to direct/produce/write plays. What is the biggest mistake someone can make in an audition? Arriving late to the audition. Give yourself ample time to find the audition. Resisting faculty’s direction to try the monologue again with a different approach. Can first year students audition for mainstage shows their first semester? Not the first semester – the fall performances are cast at the end of the previous spring semester, before the first-years arrive on campus. First-years will also be busy with their crew assignments in costume, lighting, or scenery on top of acclimating themselves to college life that first semester. Second semester first-years can, and are expected to, audition. Applications Can you explain the thing about submitting both your SMU application and your Meadows application & audition in one semester please? Sure! The Theatre degree has a “dual admission” process, and it takes time to complete the process: After submitting the completed Meadows Theatre Application, applicants will register for an audition. About two weeks after the audition, Meadows will email its admission decision to the applicant and will also let the SMU Office of Undergraduate Admission know what the decision is. Then, SMU will send its admission decision to the applicant. If you send in your completed applications and do your audition within the same semester, your admission decisions —one from Meadows, the other from SMU -- will arrive about two weeks apart. However, if, for example, a Theatre applicant applies to SMU Early Action or Early Decision I in the fall semester but doesn’t audition for Meadows until the spring semester, the admission decisions from Meadows and from SMU will arrive later in the spring semester, causing the applicant to wait until mid-spring to find out whether they have been admitted to Meadows and/or to SMU. When will I hear if I am accepted to the Theatre program or not? Whether you audition either in person (on campus, Unifieds, or Theatre conferences) or via Zoom, you will receive your Meadows admission decision about two weeks after the audition. Note that your SMU admission decision will follow about two weeks after your Meadows decision. If I want to apply to SMU early, should I apply Early Action or Early Decision I? For Theatre applicants, Early Action. Here’s why: Early Decision is a binding agreement to attend SMU if you are accepted to the university, even if you are not also accepted to the Meadows Theatre Division. For those who wish to apply by the November 1 “Early” deadline, we recommend that Theatre applicants select “Early Action” instead of “Early Decision.” By applying Early Action, Theatre applicants can keep their options open while expressing strong interest in SMU. If I apply Regular Decision or Early Decision II, will that hurt my chances of being accepted to the Theatre program? Not at all! Know that Meadows considers all of the auditions, whether you audition in the fall or spring semester. We want you to apply and audition when you think you will be at your best. Regular and Early Decision II applications to SMU are due Jan. 15. What if I am admitted to SMU but not to the Theatre program? That does sometimes happen, and is the main reason why we encourage early applicants to apply to SMU as Early Action and not Early Decision. If you are accepted to SMU but not to the Theatre program, you and your family will need to decide whether you go to SMU and pursue a major other than Theatre, or select a different university. Okay, but what if I am admitted to Theatre but not to SMU? In order to attend SMU and pursue the BFA in Theatre, applicants must apply to and be admitted to both SMU and to Meadows School of the Arts Division of Theatre. If you are admitted to Theatre but not to SMU, you’ll need to select a different university. Any tips on increasing my chances of being admitted to SMU? High grades, activity in your school, community, place of worship, etc. Keep in touch with your SMU admission counselor; attend some SMU and/or Meadows events (keep checking your email for event announcements and registrations) and show your active interest in SMU. Tell Me More... Is there a minor in Theatre? No, a minor in Theatre is not offered, but there are approximately 85 minor degrees offered at SMU, including the arts entrepreneurship minor and the arts management minor. I’m a transfer student who wants to start SMU in the fall and major in Theatre, but I missed all the auditions. If I audition in the upcoming fall and am accepted, can I start my classes in the spring, or must I wait until the following fall? All new Theatre undergraduate students must begin their Theatre studies in the fall semester. If you enter SMU in the spring, you can start taking the SMU Common Curriculum courses, then begin your Theatre studies the following fall. Theatre transfer students are usually enrolled for 3 full years as they complete the degree. Do you integrate with the arts community in Dallas? Yes yes yes! We enjoy a long-running relationship with the Tony award-winning Best Regional Theatre, Dallas Theater Center. Our students and faculty work with them every year. Our students also often audition for productions at Theatre Three, Kitchen Dog Theatre (founded by Meadows Theatre alums), Prism Co (also founded by Meadows Theatre alums), Lyric Stage (professional musical theatre company), Second Thought Theatre and more.

Hear from students and alumni about the many ways these experiences help prepare them for their careers. Advertising Olivia Ramirez BA in Advertising/Digital Media Strategy; BA in Art ’22 I had the opportunity to work as a media intern for Heineken USA the summer before my senior year. I learned so much through this position attending meetings with people from Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and their ad agency CANVAS. Along with attending meetings throughout the day, I was tasked with creating a presentation where I provided recommendations on how Heineken can better connect with Gen Z. A lot of my input was about how they can better their social media accounts. It went so well that I ended up presenting it three different times to different teams when I was only supposed to present it once! Overall, I gained great experience and industry contacts while working on the brand side of advertising, and further developed my teamwork, research, and presentation skills. Madison Castellano B.A. Advertising/Creative; minor in graphic design ’19 During my internship at Citrus Advertising, I worked with the Alpha Project, a personal training gym known for its intense and effective workout programs and strong, close-knit community. I helped develop a 360 marketing campaign. Working with the owners of the gym, we created the brand’s new logo, produced out-of-home and in-store signage, designed t-shirts and other apparel and accessories, then developed an in-depth marketing plan that broke down budget, business objectives and goals within a detailed calendar for the next few years. This project allowed me to fully immerse myself into a brand and work directly with the client to help bring their business forward. This is why I love advertising; it’s wonderful to help a client with such a compelling story, who is passionate about their dream, find their own voice and find ways to tell that story to people who want to listen and contribute to that growing dream. Next year I will be working at TracyLocke as a junior copywriter for Samsung. Hannah Tymochko B.A. Advertising/Digital Media Strategy; minor in psychology '19 Working as a brand media intern at The Richards Group gave me the real-life experience most students look for. I worked on projects for various clients that sharpened my planning, reporting and analytical thinking skills. I did a variety of projects for multiple clients at various points of the planning stage. This enabled me to see all the elements that go into media planning. Throughout my internship, I got more involved in the programmatic specialty. I learned about programmatic in many of my digital media strategy classes, and working with the team allowed me to see what type of work it actually entails. I produced client-facing documents and was given the opportunity to own projects that made me a key member of the team. My experience at The Richards Group gave me insight into agency life and overall was extremely positive and valuable. Anna Grace Godoy B.A. Advertising/Creative, minor in sociology ’19 During the spring semester of my senior year, I interned at 3HeadedMonster in Dallas. It was amazing because I got to have a hand on so many different projects because it was a small agency. I worked on campaigns for Nothing Bundt Cakes, Wingstop, products and companies that haven't been released yet, and different personal branding projects. I even got to do some branding for the agency itself. I loved my internship at 3HM because it allowed me to see so many different sides of agency life and meet some solid people. It taught me a lot about life in the work force and skills that would help me in any field I go into. Hannah Belsinger (B.A. Advertising, minor in law and legal reasoning ’19) As a brand media intern at The Richards Group in summer 2018, I was able to explore the many specialties within media planning including search engine optimization, digital strategy, media buying and social media across multiple accounts. Having such hands-on and diverse experience working with various teams allowed me to grow not only as a media planner but also as a professional and team player. I also worked with other interns on a group presentation, having to refine my collaboration, research and communication skills every day. Nothing will get you more prepared for the industry than having to give a 25-minute presentation in front of the entire department, which consisted of 100+ directors, planners, buyers and strategists. Getting such exposure to the unique culture of an ad agency allowed me to better understand how every discipline works together to successfully tackle every client’s needs. The Richards Group is a great place for anyone looking to speak up and have their ideas valued and put to great use. Amy Cooley B.A. Advertising/Strategic Brand Management; B.A. in Spanish ’18 “I spent fall semester 2017 interning for the nationally syndicated radio show ‘The Kidd Kraddick Morning Show.”’ While I got to play around on their various social platforms, my main task was running the show’s Twitter feed. It’s kind of crazy, honestly, to think that I was putting out content to over 95,000 followers every day. I also had the opportunity to record my own podcast, ‘21 & Up,’ with my co-intern. We started an Instagram account and figured out the right combination of buttons to hit in a recording studio to make magic happen. Working there was a great experience, getting to see the ins and outs of what it takes to run a radio show, how advertising and marketing works from the media side, and getting to meet some very cool people along the way – celebrities and the fun people who work there. Most importantly, however, I learned to never take for granted getting to sleep past 5:00 a.m. every morning.” [Amy is now a project manager for Dieste, Dallas/New York.] Alex Gurasich B.A. Advertising/Creative and B.A. Film & Media Arts ’18 “My internship experience at GSD&M in Austin was great. I worked in the digital production department and collaborated on projects for Popeyes and the United States Air Force. Some of those projects included testing and distributing recruitment tools for the Air Force and brainstorming on future interactive campaigns for Popeyes. GSD&M also hosted workshops for interns to meet with members from each team at the agency, along with meeting the founders and CEO of the company. Being able to make these kinds of connections and learn about the various teams that work at an agency was incredible and exactly what I was looking for in an internship. All of my coworkers have been friendly and helpful and I could not have asked for a better place to be. I’m honored to have been part of the AAF Vance and Betty Lee Stickell internship.” Marissa Lopez B.A. Advertising 2016 “My internship with Southwest Airlines was extremely rewarding and allowed me to be extremely hands-on and involved in the brand beginning to end. I created digital content for Southwest.com and the Southwest mobile application. One of the biggest takeaways from this experience was the importance of company culture. Southwest embodies everything one would look for when it comes to a wonderful work environment. I got to work with friendly, hard-working individuals whose drive and creativity inspired me. My boss and supervisors understood the importance of work-life balance and really worked with me whenever I felt overwhelmed. My internship with Southwest was truly beneficial for my growth as a designer and young professional. My Meadows professors gave me the tools and knowledge to walk into this internship with confidence and an excellent design and advertising skill set. Southwest gave me the real-world experience that prepared me to succeed in my post-graduation career now.“ [Marissa now works as a junior designer at BBDO New York.] Samantha Butz B.A. Advertising/Creative; B.A. Fashion Media '17 "I was able to travel to the Dominican Republic through SMU's Engaged Learning program. There, I got to experience the culture while visiting a living-wage garment factory and staying in the homes of the workers. I took everything I learned and have created an initiative on campus to promote ethical apparel. The underlying goal is to let students know that sweatshops are unnecessary but also, and more importantly, that we can make a difference in people's lives by the way we choose to purchase items in our everyday life. I want students to know that we are the difference and we have the power to prove that ethical apparel is possible. With the help of my professors and experience through advertising classes, I've been able to create a conversation on campus around the origin of our shirts. It's been an exciting and challenging experience and I'm excited to see how it impacts SMU in the future! In addition, in summer 2016 I had the opportunity to serve as creative intern with Weller Media Agency in New York City, which was an amazing experience. And I'm excited to be interning with Dallas-based Canonball Agency for the fall of my senior year.” (Photo: Samantha with Alta Gracia garment factory worker Alfredo Toledo.) [Samantha is now art director for Citrus Advertising, Dallas.] Tien Dang B.A. Advertising/Creative ’16 "I was a creative copy intern at Publicis HCG in New York City in summer 2015. The coolest part of my internship was being put on a pitch where I worked directly with the associate creative director. My input and ideas were valued and some of my concepts were utilized. I was also a part of a larger internship program called MAIP, which provided me with a lot of awesome opportunities and connections as well. Interning in New York has been a great experience." [Tien now works as the diversity and inclusion coordinator for 4A’s in New York.] Sue Hyun Han B.A. Advertising/Creative ’16 "I loved my first agency experience! I did my internship through MAIP (Multicultural Advertising Intern Program), which placed me in McCann Detroit. The people at McCann Detroit were so kind and accommodating. When I realized that I didn't want to do account management they let me help out in creative. I got to see how everyone in the agency worked together. I became close friends with the fellow interns; we brainstormed together, ate lunch together and came up with our first ads together. Through MAIP, I was also able to go to New York City where we found out that our group won the 2015 MAIP Summer Project for Nike and Wieden+Kennedy." Art Gabi Graceffo B.F.A. Art and B.A. English/Creative Writing Specialization ’20 “While studying abroad in Siena, Italy, for a semester, I was able to work at a graphic design studio, Mc Brain’s, as a graphic designer, photographer and translator. This internship built on my experience with magazine work as the editor-in-chief of Kairos, SMU’s premier undergraduate literary and creative magazine, combining my artistic studies with my writing. I became a translator for the studio and was able to bridge them with English and American companies they had previously had limited access to. The internship skyrocketed my graphic design and linguistic skills and I was offered a job and visa sponsorship at the end of the semester, something I’m considering taking them up on before grad school. I was able to pursue this experience because of Meadows scholarships and have come back ready to dive into my senior year, now with more experience to look toward future work with creative magazine work as both a writer and artist.” Jennifer Wester M.F.A. Art ’21 "Through a project grant and residency with the City of Dallas, provided through the Dallas Office of Arts and Culture, I've had the extensively rewarding opportunity to design and distribute culturally specific paper modeling activities and workshops that hone fine motor skills and spatial reasoning while providing creative inspiration to underserved communities in the area. This work has furthered my paper-works practice, led me to develop important grant writing and project scheduling skills critical to a sustainable arts career and led to the creation of many positive relationships with other local organizations and city entities such as the Dallas Public Library, Love For Kids, Deep Vellum Publishing and Dallas Park & Recreation facilities. The ability to work in collaboration with and have so much agency in a city as large and diverse as Dallas has been invaluable in the development of my goals and vision as an artist. I don't believe there is any other city in the country with as much opportunity for artists to have voice and impact as in Dallas right now." Julia Jalowiec B.F.A. Art ’18 “I came to Meadows as a transfer student and right away dove into the resources and opportunities SMU had to offer. In addition to classes and a trip to study in France, I did an internship with sculptor Deborah Ballard; conducted funded research as an Engaged Learning Fellow on Art Fellowship in Paris, which resulted in a solo sculpture show in downtown Dallas; held a resident artist internship at the Dallas Farmers Market (DFM), for which I organized a collaborative, 150-foot public art wall mural. After the DFM internship, I started work on another public art wall mural and curated a large-scale steel sculpture show featuring the work of artist Dewane Hughes. My opportunities helped me grow not only as an artist, they also helped me grow my network in the art community.” [Photo Southern Methodist University, Hillsman S. Jackson.] Nida Bangash M.F.A. Art ’19 "I'm thrilled to be invited to participate in an exhibition celebrating The Crow Collection of Asian Art Museum's 20th Anniversary this year, where I have been paired with one of the objects I selected from the collection. An answer I give to a set of questions asked in an interview will be chosen as part of the object's in-gallery label. In addition to a solo exhibition at The Reading Room in Dallas in November, I am also working towards a group exhibition titled "I Contain Multitudes" at Milwaukee Institute of Art and Design in January. Here at SMU, I am fortunate to be given an opportunity to be amid a group of wonderful creatives the DFW area has to offer." Andy Davis M.F.A. Art ’16 “One of the features that attracted me to SMU for my M.F.A. in Studio Art was the potential for collaboration with other disciplines. Housed within the Owen Arts Building are the divisions of music, visual art, theatre and dance, to name a few. With the atmosphere of the various arts coexisting in the same space, I saw an opportunity to blur the boundaries between these so-called “divisions.” In my final semester, I approached students from the music and dance divisions to collaborate in producing a chamber operetta for the 2016 M.F.A. Thesis Show, “Above and Below the Surface.” The openness and rigorous abilities of the performers helped bring the work from a fragmented set of impressions to a fully realized project. Interdisciplinary experimentation, navigating unknown territories, challenging categories - these acts constitute a vibrant arts ecosystem and I am grateful to my collaborators and the faculty at Meadows for facilitating this exchange.” [See “Watergrass” video on: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSh9DzH3VpI ] D S Chapman B.F.A. Studio Art ’17 The only thing greater than the Meadows School itself are the outstanding professors who dedicate their time and effort to making students like myself successful in our chosen field. Since my junior year, I have been an exhibitions & programs intern at The Power Station, a not-for-profit contemporary art exhibition space, after Chair of the Division of Art Dr. Noah Simblist connected me with The Power Station Gallery Manager Gregory Ruppe. I have helped with the installation of two exhibitions, one of which was for the international Dallas Art Fair, and I assist with the day-to-day running of The Power Station. The Power Station permitted me to organize a screening of video work from SMU students and alums, and I have been invited to curate the work for one night of their “Sunscreen” summer film series. In addition to continuing my internship at The Power Station during my senior year, I will be working as the studio assistant to artist Jeff Zilm (M.F.A. ’11), a former SMU alumnus. [DS was accepted to three grad schools and will attend University of California San Diego beginning fall 2017.] Diana Antohe B.F.A. Art ’14 My time at Meadows was instrumental in setting the foundation for my career, and continues on with having an incredible and supportive community in the Dallas arts. The summer after graduation I got a studio in the Deep Ellum district in Dallas, where I currently hold my professional studio practice. My studio space has led to several past and upcoming exhibitions. I'll be showing works at a downtown gallery in the spring; I recently had a show with another painter at North Lake College; was selected as a "Rising Star" for the Turner House exhibition at the Oak Cliff Society of Fine Arts; and will be in a women printmaking show at the Bath House Cultural Center in the spring. I am also a studio assistant to another Meadows alumnus, Matthew Cusick (M.F.A. ’13), whom I met during my studies. [Note: In 2016, Diana had residencies at the London Summer Intensive Residency and at the Can Serrat International Center in El Bruc, Spain. Upcoming residencies include the Vermont Studio Center in spring 2017.] Nicolas Gonzalez B.F.A. Art, B.A. Art History ’17 Over the summer I was granted an opportunity to be a part of Pike Park’s first-ever summer camp, where I worked with children ages 5 through 12. Together we were able to construct a huge mural titled “My Pike Park” to bring awareness to the diminishing history of Pike Park and of Little Mexico here in Dallas. This project directed the use of my artistic abilities using a different approach known as social practice. It has opened new possibilities for me, such as a new body of work and recognition throughout the art community. I’ve always believed that art can change the world in some way. (Photo by Parker Smitherman [B.F.A. Film & Media Arts ’15]) Art History Claudia Zapata Ph.D. candidate in Art History ’19 “In the summer of 2017, I was selected as a Marsh Foundation Curatorial Intern by the Georgia O’Keeffe Museum. As an intern I developed several feasibility reports related to prospective virtual reality applications and programming. The museum’s unique organization as a single-artist museum with historical properties in a remote area provided a unique challenge for integrating technological innovation as a form of preservation. The internship allowed me to extend my professional curatorial experience to a world-renowned museum that incorporates its natural landscape as part of the visitor experience. Each museum has a specific set of opportunities it provides for its visitors, and as an intern, I was able to gain more valuable insight into the considerations of the single-artist museum. The administrative and programmatic diversity training that I receive from such experiences is an invaluable professional asset that will incentivize any future employer regarding my abilities to adapt to an arts institution’s professional objectives.” Lauren Richman M.A. Art History ’13; Ph.D. candidate in Art History ’19 "Fellowships complement the pursuit of a Ph.D. in art history by expanding students’ resources and enriching their professional network. For the 2017-18 academic year, I was awarded the Terra Foundation for American Art Predoctoral Fellowship at the Smithsonian American Art Museum (SAAM), which honors projects focused on cross-cultural exchange. While at SAAM, I have been able to access archival materials for dissertation research/writing which concluded in a public lecture, work one-on-one with curators, and meet scholars across disciplines thanks to Washington, D.C.’s rich museum community. Not only has my time at SAAM been instrumental for the completion of my Meadows degree, but also it has provided me with valuable exposure to curatorial work. With the support of the faculty in the Art History Department, I have been able to tailor my education and external opportunities to suit my career ambitions." Lauren King B.A. Art History ’18 “As a student interested in both art history and archaeology, interning with the Perot Museum of Nature and Science was a fulfilling experience. It allowed me to pursue both of my interests in the workplace, understand how research is done in a museum setting and meet people with similar backgrounds further along in their careers. I left the internship with much more knowledge on the workings of a museum, and on what steps I can take to better my chances for success in the future. This internship was a valuable opportunity to match my education with correlating work experience and to gain a better understanding in what kind of projects I enjoy doing outside the classroom.” Rachel Spradley M.A. Art History ’15 As a graduate student hoping to pursue a career in museums, I knew internships would be an important part of achieving my goals. With support from the Meadows Art History faculty, I gained museum work experience both during and after my graduate work. An internship at the Metropolitan Museum in New York offered an opportunity to learn about the variety of roles available throughout a large museum. Now, as a 2015-16 graduate intern at the J. Paul Getty Museum, I am gaining valuable firsthand experience in the Exhibitions department, which manages the logistics surrounding special exhibitions, coordinating the efforts of departments across the museum. The experience is a valuable complement to my Meadows education and one that will further my career goals. [Rachel now works as an exhibitions assistant at the Dallas Museum of Art.] Estelle Hernandez B.A. Art History ’16 It was the best feeling when my education and work experience first began to overlap. Internships with the Dallas Contemporary and other Dallas galleries have given me the opportunity to broaden my knowledge in this field, meet people I admire and have exciting experiences like working in the Dallas Art Fair. Perhaps most important, they have given me the chance to explore my interests and hone my skills. I am currently working in a part-time position with the Dallas Museum of Art, where I have the privilege of doing research work with the Keir Collection. I owe this experience to the foundation I gained from my art history courses and the support of my professors. Lauren Janicki B.A. Art History ’16 With the Jordan Internship at the Meadows Museum I hope to gain a better understanding of the people who are responsible for the everyday and special operations of a museum. I will use my time here at Meadows to help get a better sense of what career I will pursue in the art and museum world and to decide what steps I need to take after I graduate from SMU. I also hope to make lasting connections with the people here who might be able to help and guide me in the next stages of my life. Arts Management & Arts Entrepreneurship Molly McNulty B.A. in Public Relations and Strategic Communication; minor in Arts Management ’20 I had the internship of a lifetime at House of Blues as the marketing and talent buyer intern. As their intern, my favorite task was capturing content from various concerts each month and posting it to the House of Blues Instagram story. Some concerts I covered included Jeremy Zucker and Mike Shinoda. As the intern for the talent buyer, I assisted in creating artist deals for both the Cambridge Room and Music Hall. We conducted research about how a particular artist’s previous shows in Dallas or other similar venues did and created an offer using that information. Artist deals that I assisted in included Still Woozy and Rooney. My course work at SMU helped me in my internship, specifically the Cultural Policy course with Dr. Kathleen Gallagher. Throughout my semester-long project, I learned about the Music Modernization Act, which made me even more excited for a career in the music industry. Valerie Pizzato M.A./M.B.A. Candidate and Forté Fellow ’20 I interned at the Dallas Theater Center in their development department. Coming from a nonprofit theater in New York City, it was enlightening to see the difference in the arts fundraising environment in these two cities. I gained experience with many aspects of fundraising, from individual giving to events, which builds upon SMU’s fall Fundraising in the Arts course. My direct supervisor was an alumna of the M.A./M.B.A. program, Robin Rose ’10, and I had a tremendous time learning from her. While working on individual giving goals, I mastered the art of donor research. I also learned how to use Tessitura, which is central to patron management at many arts organizations. I am well prepared to hold conversations with leaders across the organization about their strategies. My time at the Dallas Theater Center gave me experience at a premiere regional theater (2017 Tony winner, Best Regional Theater) while applying classroom knowledge to real world situations. Paige Harrington M.A./M.B.A. Candidate and Forte Fellow ’19 "My internship with Deep Vellum Publishing initiated me into the Dallas fundraising climate. Because it is such a young organization, I was able to work side by side with the executive director and production editor to build Deep Vellum’s contributed income portfolio and address the organization’s financial needs. I attended grant writing seminars hosted by prominent Dallas nonprofit organizations and wrote 10 grants for four different upcoming projects and programs. The fundraising courses with Julia Diaz provided all the knowledge and practice that I needed to be successful in development. Each of the M.A professors share current, first-hand experience, providing a unique awareness of nonprofit function, which was integral to my success during my internship. I walked into Deep Vellum with not only a passion for books but all the essential knowledge to help the organization continue to grow. I gained a new understanding of running a business with a dynamic environment, which has prepared me to launch my own nonprofit publishing house." Julia Farina M.A./M.B.A. Candidate and Forte Fellow ’19 “As the development intern at Theatre Communications Group (TCG) I was able to work with both their Individual Giving & Specials Events and Institutional Advancement & Partnerships departments. This dual position allowed me to experience and work on projects that touched many aspects of fundraising. Summer is a busy time at TCG - they host their annual national conference in June, the end of their fiscal year occurs in July, gala planning is underway and many foundation reports and government grant applications are due. While working on these things and more, I was able to work on hard skills, such as mastering Raiser’s Edge and writing grant proposals, and soft skills, such as communicating with current and prospective donors and managing cross-functional teams. TCG is truly at the center of the nonprofit theater world, and it was a fantastic experience being able to witness and learn about all the amazing work happening in the field nationwide.” Angie Reisch B.F.A. Art, minor in arts entrepreneurship ’18; SMU President’s Scholar, Meadows Scholar "While I was interning at the North Texas Business Council for the Arts (BCA) in Dallas, I worked on a research project looking at which businesses in North Texas were supporting arts and cultural organizations. It was the first time I had worked on such a long-term and exhaustive research project and worked with a professional economist to analyze my work. The results of the research will be published in a white paper in fall 2018. My internship was incredibly valuable to me because I got to see firsthand how an arts nonprofit operates and runs on a day-to-day basis, which was something I had learned a lot about in my AMAE classes. I am very excited to be working with BCA full time now as their programs manager." [Photo: Reisch, lower left, with BCA staff members and volunteers at the 2017 BCA Obelisk Awards.] Andrew Reynolds M.A./M.B.A. ’18 During my internship at Interlochen Center for the Arts, I was an events manager and administrative assistant for Trey Devey, Interlochen’s newly appointed president. The opportunity to witness and collaborate on the transition of power, multiple methods of executive time management, board relations, external relations, restructuring and the confidential and critical issues that run through the president’s office has been invaluable to crafting my own executive strategy. The M.A./M.B.A. allowed me to have substantive conversations with senior management. The M.A. portion of the degree has prepared me with the most up-to-date and researched practices in arts and culture management, development, nonprofit finance and governance. The M.B.A. has prepared me for operational success, financial awareness, conversations with a board primarily made up of for-profit business minds and deriving strategy based on the current economic environment. Without both parts of the degree, successfully managing all relevant stakeholders of an arts and culture organization would prove much more challenging. Mariama Holman M.A./M.B.A. ’18 My internship experience at Americans for the Arts in New York City helped me understand the broader role the arts play in creating an economic impact within their communities. By working on projects relating to the Arts & Economic Prosperity 5 Study and the Business Contributions to the Arts: 2017 research, I learned how local arts agencies can meet head-to-head with other industries within their community to advocate for partnerships and initiatives that support the development of the arts economy. My graduate coursework in marketing with Zannie Voss and Jill Robinson was instrumental in understanding not only the complex ecosystem of arts community stakeholders, but also learning how to cultivate unilateral interest in Americans for the Arts content among businesses, chambers of commerce and local arts agencies. Chelsea Marshall M.A./M.B.A. ’18 “The lessons and case studies from Meadows were an integral part of my day at the Solomon R. Guggenheim, where I interned in the marketing department. Courses like ‘Nonprofit Marketing Strategy’ and ‘Audience Development & Marketing in the Arts’ provided me with the confidence to jump right into projects and the practical experience to collaborate on teams. Through digital strategy and brand positioning initiatives, I helped promote public awareness and monitor visitor experiences at the museum. The Guggenheim also encouraged interns to gain a broad understanding of museum operations and the cultural community through its Museum Culture Seminar Program. These discussions with gallery owners, curators, artists, and designers offered a unique insight into the art mecca of New York City as well as the broader role of museums in our world.” Phuong Vu M.A./M.B.A. ’17 “It was an exciting time to intern at the Georgia O’Keeffe Museum communications department with their recent re-branding effort and big international travelling exhibitions, all during the busiest travel season in Santa Fe. I benefited greatly from the Web & Social Media Analytics course at SMU Cox School of Business, where I learned more about cutting-edge tools and refined digital media strategy. My Meadows courses all set the firm foundation for my understanding of nonprofit organizations, challenged my marketing views, allowed me to see the big picture and helped improve my collaboration skills with other departments. The impact of data-driven decisions in art administration has opened my perspective to a new career track.” Veronica Treviño M.A./M.B.A. ’17 “Having the good fortune to intern in the multifaceted exhibitions department of the Dallas Museum of Art, I enjoyed a very dynamic experience, with exposure to an assortment of tasks and responsibilities. Comprised of a multitude of departments, the museum’s welcoming staff made scheduled and impromptu informational interviews possible. Possessing a cursory knowledge of the diverse sets of priorities and obligations held by the various constituents involved in a nonprofit organization was a framework afforded by my course work. This context propelled my conversations at the museum into fruitful and potent exchanges of knowledge that I will take with me throughout my career.” [Photo: Veronica at the Dallas Museum of Art.] Caroline Webb M.A./M.B.A. ’17 “My experience as the annual fund and donor benefits intern at The Santa Fe Opera contributed greatly to my comprehensive understanding of the fundraising process. Lessons learned in SMU’s M.A./M.B.A program - especially in Fundraising in the Arts and Advanced Fundraising Strategy with JoLynne Jensen - were critical to successfully meeting the challenges of my hands-on involvement in the fundraising and special events activities of this world-class development department. Applying lessons learned at SMU to such real world situations allowed me to grow as an arts administration professional and gave me a clearer vision of possibilities going forward.” Kristen Lega M.A./M.B.A. ’16 During my time as an intern with the Dallas Symphony Orchestra, I was able to be thoroughly immersed in the arts administration atmosphere. Having the opportunity to work with a variety of departments there gave me an overarching view of the industry, as well as some hands-on involvement, and I found it to be extremely valuable. Getting that insight into the inner workings of an organization such as this provided me with a tremendous amount of new knowledge that seamlessly complements the education I am receiving through SMU’s M.A./M.B.A. program. [Kristen now works as a search coordinator for Resolution Media in Chicago, working on campaign plans, strategies and optimizations, data analysis, industry changes and more.] Emily VanderWall M.A./M.B.A. ’16 I had the opportunity to intern at the Dallas Museum of Art in the marketing department. I was given an audience overview project which allowed me to combine the concepts I was learning in class to real life situations. For instance, creating a museum budget for our finance class helped me understand potential revenue streams while our marketing class gave me ideas for direct marketing tactics and ways to utilize available data. My internship project allowed me to better understand museum audiences and exposed me to the types of strategies and goals a museum might implement from a marketing perspective. [After her subsequent internship at Christie’s, Emily now works as a category marketing specialist for Heritage Auctions.] Corporate Communication and Public Affairs Lauren Lehner B.A. Corporate Communication and Public Affairs; B.A. Public Policy ’21 "During my time as a policy intern at Cornerstone Government Affairs, I had the tremendous opportunity to gain an in-depth understanding of the field of government relations and how private industry influences policy. Additionally, working with a myriad of clients allowed me to not only deepen my understanding of certain policy areas, but also learn and expand those interests to encompass other areas. Over the course of my internship, I was also able to see firsthand how important clear and thoughtful communication is in ensuring the best materials are given to more senior individuals within the firm and ultimately to our clients.&nbsp; My assignments included viewing and summarizing congressional hearings, by drafting analysis memos, identifying and reporting on the current news and legislation trends, and preparing materials for clients testifying before Congress.&nbsp; All of these experiences collectively sharpened my critical thinking and writing skills. As I look toward starting law school, I believe the skills and tools I gained from this internship will prove quite valuable and will help me succeed in the future." Melanie Ekizian B.A. Public Relations and Strategic Communications; B.A. Environmental Studies; minor in Environmental Anthropology ’20 My experience as the global communications intern at Salesforce in San Francisco gave me a true look into the world of public relations in the tech industry. During my 12-week internship, I worked alongside talented professionals who focused on product public relations, corporate affairs and the company blog. By working at such an expansive company, I was able to learn about crisis response in real time and even assisted in the creation of a crisis and issues management toolkit. Additionally, I learned the company's data analytics program to provide insight for future projects across all teams. By the end of my summer, I was excited to share my well-rounded experience with my classes during my senior year and apply my learnings to my future career.

More so, it became extremely apparent to me how critical communication is in ensuring that multinational corporations can operate efficiently wherever they’re present. As an intern focusing on global digital communications I had the chance to see how data science is becoming an increasingly dynamic and exciting space to work in as a public affairs professional. Being able to understand the science behind how individuals interact with messaging so that you can increase people’s understanding of your company is pivotal. As I continue my professional development, the understanding I have been able to gain as a result of working in an evolving media environment for multinational corporation will continue to offer me an invaluable perspective going forward.” Caroline Curran B.A. Public Relations and Strategic Communication; B.A. Corporate Communication and Public Affairs/Political; minor in Law and Legal Reasoning ’19 "My internship experiences have prepared me for life beyond graduation in ways I never could have imagined. From the Washington, D.C.-based Twenty-First Century Group, I learned valuable skills in congressional and client relations, even creating materials to aid in winning a $15 million grant for one of our clients. As an external affairs intern at the George W. Bush Presidential Center (Dallas), I assisted the editor in chief with transcription of interviews for their new book, Listening to Leaders, including an interview with former President George W. Bush. At The Power Group, I have learned the ins and outs of media relations. From pitching stories to providing on-site assistance at interviews and television segments, the experience I gained has shaped me into the well-rounded student and professional I am today. Upon graduation, I am excited to begin my career as an account coordinator with RKD Group, a leading fundraising and marketing agency to over 250 regional and national nonprofits."

Introduced to QMobius and its CEO, Carolyn Covey Morris, by Professor Sandra Duhé, I immediately felt a sense of camaraderie and a collaborative atmosphere, something that can be a rare find in today’s market. I worked on national accounts like HomeTeam Pest Defense, writing for social media and creating fact sheets for their customers. For Nissan and INFINITI Financial Services, I supported the team for customer and consumer research and assisted in upgrading communications to improve their customers’ journey; we also worked on videos to welcome new customers and to help customers through the end-of-lease experience. The QMobius team cares for each other and their clients. Successes are shared, and impediments are treated as reminders for constant improvement and refinement. The internship was a whirlwind, but few companies afford their interns the experiences and responsibilities that QMobius did. I am grateful for that." [Photo: Shaya Gaziani, left, at lunch with QMobius coworkers.] Beth Rose B.A. Corporate Communication and Public Affairs/Organizational Communication; B.A. Advertising/Digital Media Strategy ’18 (Dec.) "I had the opportunity to intern with AT&T in summer 2018, primarily working on project management for their sales and service centers. My main project was to find a nonprofit for the centers to partner with and get employees involved in a fun, easy and engaging way. For example, we partnered with Alex’s Lemonade Stand Foundation to have lemonade stands across the country and raise money to fund childhood cancer research. This required me to work with a large group of employees to inform centers about our partnership. Taking what I had learned in my CCPA classes, I was able to effectively communicate with people all across our organization. From visiting employees in our Houston and Austin centers to presenting my ideas to all of the chiefs of staff in my organization, I was able to get a good idea of what AT&T’s sales and service centers do and why they’re important. One of the most significant things I am taking away from this internship is that you need to love the company you work for. If you love the culture and the people you work with, it doesn’t feel like work at all." Yamleque Murillo B.A. Public Relations & Strategic Communication ’18 “At LDWW Group, I was able to grow professionally and personally. I felt more than prepared to take on my tasks as an intern thanks to the knowledge I gained from my CCPA classes. During my internship experience I realized how much the CCPA classes really mimic real-world public relations work, as nothing I was assigned was ever completely unfamiliar. At LDWW I worked on many client projects that ranged from sending out pitches, tracking media coverage, and event planning, to creating a crisis communications plan for a beverage company client! I feel satisfied knowing that I will continue using the skills learned in my CCPA classes on a daily basis in my career and future endeavors.” Courtney Baptiste B.A. Public Relations and Strategic Communication; B.A. Corporate Communication and Public Affairs/Political Communication ’17 (Dec.) “My classes in the CCPA department helped me find my passion for digital marketing, which I was able to apply at my internship as a social media and public relations intern at Ten90Success. The CCPA curriculum allows you to pursue so many different specializations within public relations. This allowed me to develop videography skills, which really differentiated me within my internship. Throughout my time at Ten90Success, I had opportunities to do everything from strategic planning to video production and editing. In addition, I was able to work closely with clients, which helped me to further develop my professional communication skills, which will be an asset as I move forward in my career.” Gabby Greig B.A. in Public Relations and Strategic Communication ’17 “I felt prepared coming into my internship at Bratskeir & Company, a public relations firm in New York City, because of the knowledge I gained in my Meadows classes over the past three years at SMU. Prior to the internship I had worked with clients in the local Dallas area, learned how to write the perfect pitch, prepared public relations strategies and learned all about business literacy, among other skills. At Bratskeir, I got to learn everything that goes into creating a successful event, including connecting with clients and customers leading up to, during and after the event. I also learned first-hand everything about keeping a mutually beneficial relationship between a company and its clients, which is essential for the field I am pursuing.” Andy Embody B.A. Public Relations and Strategic Communication ’17 “I would not have been able to succeed at my internship with the Washington Redskins if not for all of the material I learned in my classes at SMU. The repetition and practice of AP Style writing gave me the tools I needed to succeed in editing and writing various forms of writing such as press releases, bios and fact sheets. This internship gave me a great deal of experience in interacting with members of the media in a professional manner, which is something I will need to continue a career in sports PR.” [Andy also interned with the Dallas Stars in spring 2017.] Natalie Yezbick (B.A. Journalism; B.A. Public Relations and Strategic Communications; and B.A. Communication Studies ’15) Press Assistant for Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) "I wouldn't be working on the Hill without doing internships in different disciplines. Who else but an SMU Meadows student can say they were published on the front page of a newspaper in a top five media market and interned for a past President in the same school year? My professors gave me the tools to be one of the best in any of the fields I could have pursued, and that is the best kind of job security." Emily Grace Walsh (B.A. Public Relations and Strategic Communication ’15), Account Executive, Brynn Bagot Public Relations, Dallas "After two great internships as an undergrad with Weber Shandwick in their Chicago and Dallas offices, I accepted an account executive position at Brynn Bagot Public Relations in Dallas shortly after graduation. I would not have been able to accept this position without the skills I learned in the SMU Communication Studies program. On a daily basis, I consistently use my writing skills, research skills and interpersonal skills to communicate directly with clients." [Emily is now a corporate communications specialist for Mary Kay Inc.] Creative Computation Kyle Baker B.A. Creative Computing; minors in Musical Theatre and Graphic Design ’20 “This past summer I served as the creative intern for MarketScale, a business-to-business marketing firm in downtown Dallas. I worked in the Creative Department doing 3D animation. It was an awesome hands-on experience where I was working on real projects from day one. I learned more about the 3D animation production pipeline through storyboarding, creating photorealistic textures, lighting and doing camera work. My manager worked with me to develop my skills in each of these areas. He showed me how to see things as an animator. Now when I see an object made of something as general as say, plastic, I notice the subtle nuances that give it its own distinct character. For example, I notice its surface’s small imperfections, or the way the light hits it and reflects. This experience was phenomenal and I am so excited to apply what I learned back into my classes this fall.” Eric Miao B.A. Creative Computing, B.A. Computer Science ’20; Second Century Scholar In the summer of 2018, I worked as a web development and design intern at Nickson, LLC. The internship gave me firsthand knowledge on how to transform classroom work to real-world projects. It was an honor to work directly with the management and technology teams at Nickson, headquartered in Dallas with a satellite office in New York City. During my time at Nickson, my main project revolved around the collaborating and developing of Nickson’s new website as well as creating collateral to be used by the chief marketing officer in her marketing campaign. My creative computing and computer science background gave me a strong foundation to think both as an artist and as an engineer. The courses I took at SMU prepared me for the challenges that arose and helped me deliver projects through effective communication and collaboration. The work forced me to be extremely detail oriented and diligent in every task presented. Overall, my internship enhanced my hard and soft skills and made me a better person going forward. Stejara Dinulescu B.A. Creative Computing, B.A. Studio Art, B.S.

This work is through the Social and Clinical Neuroscience lab, led by Dr. Benjamin Tabak. Before I was able to begin running statistical analyses, I had to sort and process tens of thousands of data points from our large research study conducted over the past year. Instead of spending weeks completing this manually, I was able to write a program in a few hours to automate this process with practically no error, giving me the desired data in less than a second. The creative computing department equipped me with the tools necessary for programming and problem-solving, not only in this more statistical, data-oriented realm but also in the domains of art, artificial intelligence and video game creation. One example is “Drawing with Movement,” which takes accelerometer data input from Wii remotes strapped to ballroom dancers, processes it through a Markov chain (basic probabilistic artificial intelligence) and draws lines on-screen based on their movement. The result is an interactive performance that illustrates the pure movement of the dancers as well as an autonomous “bot” that draws on-screen based on the data from the dancers. Eskinder Abebe B.A. Creative Computing ’18 “Working for the SMU Hunter and Stephanie Hunt Institute for Engineering and Humanity has been a unique experience because it incorporates different disciplines where scientists, professors and students work together to solve humanitarian issues locally and globally. My main task working there was to develop an affordable computer tablet for remote locations where education is scarce. I was also privileged to work toward the mission and goal of the Institute. In addition, I have been creating visual assets for the Institute, like logo design, brochures, flyers and posters.” Kali Ruppert B.A. Creative Computing; B.A. Art History ’16 "Last summer I worked for the design sector of SAP in Palo Alto, specifically with d.forum, the chief design officer's initiative to bring design thinking into global organizations. I also co-facilitated design thinking workshops for SAP University Alliances at the Stanford d.school, SAP, the Hanahaus in downtown Palo Alto and Delaware State University. Design thinking closely aligned with my studies at SMU, particularly my arts entrepreneurship minor. In fact, I integrated Professor Jim Hart's game, "Speed Dating Market Feedback," into several workshops. My managers and SAP clients were also very intrigued by the Creative Computing major." [Kali is now a creative technologist with RP3 Agency in Washington, D.C.] Harley Swick B.A. Creative Computing ’16 "My internship at PricewaterhouseCoopers gave me a taste of the real world and how effective my skills could be at a professional level. It was a great experience. The skills I've gained at SMU really came in handy in the workplace and the hands-on learning that I got in the Creative Computing Center gave me quite the edge. My recruitment process included a personal recommendation from my professor. Without that connection, I never would have had such a great opportunity. The best takeaway I got from the internship is a very nice offer to work at PwC when I graduate." [Harley is now an associate with PricewaterhouseCoopers.] Emely Villeda-Principe B.A. Creative Computing; B.A. Computer Science ’17 "I interned in the AT&T TDP - Emerging Technologies program in summer 2015. The best part about the internship was that I was able to work on projects specific to my interest in UI/UX Development, which greatly helped me improve my skills. Thanks to my C3 professors, I can approach problems as both an artist and programmer to take on projects that require creativity and logic." [Upon graduation, Emely began working as an associate application developer in AT&T’s software development program.] Dance Emily Slater BFA in Dance Performance; minors in Business and in Educational Studies ’22 Going into my first year at Southern Methodist University, I knew that I needed to find a complementary career path to dance and was able to utilize the online classes offered in summer 2020 to obtain a business minor. Eager and nervous, I submitted my application to American Ballet Theatre in New York. Meanwhile, I was working with Silas Farley in preparation for our Hope Show. One night I realized that Silas, a former New York City Ballet dancer, may have a connection at ABT. I decided to meet with him and talk about the opportunity. Silas was glad to help and extremely supportive of my endeavor. A few interviews later, I was offered the position in May! As the end of June was approaching, so was the premiere of the ABT Summer Celebration! For this event, I worked alongside my mentors in weekly meetings as well as emailing and documenting hundreds of donors. During this event, Silas Farley’s work Collage and Creed premiered. Before the premiere, I was honored to attend multiple zoom rehearsals and watch him create on the ABT company! Kendall Lockhart B.F.A. Dance ’19 “I had the wonderful opportunity to perform on tour in South Africa as a cast member of Wading Home, a beautiful opera about the tragedy of Hurricane Katrina. As an individual preparing to dance professionally for a dance company after college, I was eager to experience dancing on tour for the first time in a place as cultural and historically rich as South Africa. This trip impacted and enriched me professionally, artistically and spiritually. I performed at three different universities in Port Elizabeth, Cape Town and Pretoria. I learned how to travel, communicate with various types of people and how to remain a responsible and accountable company member. In my free time, I saw a multitude of incredible views, enjoyed a farm-to-table breakfast at a vineyard and toured important landmarks relating to the history of Apartheid. It both humbled and inspired me to work closely with South African university students and SMU vocal artists and musicians in collaboration. I developed deep relationships in just two weeks with people I otherwise would have never met.” Kat Barragan B.F.A. Dance Performance, B.A. History 2017 “To me, the Movement Exchange Program stands out as the most special and rare thing the Meadows Dance Division has to offer: Not only are you going on a service trip to orphanages throughout Panama, but you also get to experience classes in salsa, modern dance, aerial, and other Panamanian types of dance, with local dancers. Our guides were fellow dancers who had grown up in Panama, and for one week, they immersed us in Panama’s culture. It would be difficult to choose one memory from the trip, but my personal favorite was taking an improvisation modern class with a professional dance company in Panama City. We were given a partner for one exercise, and although I spoke awful Spanish, my partner and I were able to communicate solely through our bodies in the dance: Dance itself became connective language. I have never felt so in love with my art as I did in that moment.” [Photo: Kat, front row on the right, with fellow dancers on the beach in Panama.] Fallon Reedy B.F.A. Dance Performance ’17 “For two years now, I’ve spent my summers in downtown Dallas working for Larrwell Productions as a contracted dancer for Mary Kay’s corporate seminars held at the Kay Bailey Hutchins Convention Center. It has been such a fulfilling and worthwhile experience for me, benefiting my professionalism and diversity as an artist in so many ways. I not only learned firsthand how to conduct myself as a working professional, but I was also exposed to the incredible benefits of working in a more industrial setting, such as backup dancing for major performing artists. Dancing for Mary Kay was also a great platform that allowed me to work with other young professionals in and around the Dallas area. My training from Meadows definitely prepared me for an experience like this, especially in terms of the audition process. The audition experience I receive at SMU is a direct representation of what to expect in the real world, and for that preparation I’m very grateful.” [Photo: Fallon, right, at Mary Kay event with Sarah Larr of Larrwell Productions.] Molly Kate Dalton B.F.A. Dance Performance ’18 During spring break I traveled to Panama through the Movement Exchange organization. We taught dance to kids ages 5-15 who were living in orphanages. Although the language barrier was a challenge at first, within a few days we were all brought together through our love of movement, and we witnessed moments of pure bliss. My return to the States made me realize there is so much more to dance than meets the eye: It is a passion, a way of expression, and it is the universal language. My dance professors at SMU teach from a place of passion, heart and encouragement, which have helped me grow as a dancer and a person. I can only hope that I have touched someone’s life in the way my professors and peers have touched mine. Mallory Ketch B.F.A. Dance Performance Dec. 2015 Dancing in the Bruce Wood Dance Project's "5 Years" show advanced my knowledge of the professional dance world. I experienced tremendous growth in my technique, my knowledge of professionalism as an artist and my ability to adapt to new choreographic ideas. I brought my experiences from this inspiring environment back into my work as a dance major at SMU. I also will never forget dancing in the José Limón Festival at the Joyce Theater in New York City with the Division of Dance. These opportunities have shaped me tremendously as a dancer, positively influencing my work at SMU and preparing me for a successful career in dance. Emily Bernet B.F.A. Dance Performance ’16 Outside of Meadows Division of Dance, I have had the incredible opportunity to perform with Dark Circles Contemporary Dance USA, directed by SMU alumni Joshua L. Peugh. Working with DCCD has given me valuable professional experience, teaching me the challenges and rewards of being a part of a professional dance company. In addition to performing in Dallas, I have toured with the company to New York, Houston, Austin and the Jacob’s Pillow Dance Festival in Massachusetts, where we met and performed alongside inspiring artists from all over America and abroad. Rehearsing and performing with the company has allowed me to put all of the training I have gained at SMU into practice in a professional environment and become more involved in the Dallas dance community.

Film and Media Arts; minor in arts management ’20 "After working as a seasonal guest services worker at Live Nation Entertainment – a national live events promoter and music venue operator – at the Dallas Dos Equis Pavilion over summer 2018, I applied for and was offered their operation internship for the 2019 concert season. I learned how to manage stress, both my own and other people’s; how to take the reins of a situation even if it is “above your pay grade”; and witnessed first-hand the delicacy it takes to manage all of the moving parts in such a complex machine. I also learned what a truly phenomenal manager looks like. These experiences taught me to try things. Through it all, I was offered a third internship with Live Nation Productions, their movie production branch in Los Angeles, a place where my love for music and film meet in the middle." Aggie Ryan B.F.A. Film and Media Arts ’20, minor in arts management "Filmmaking is more than just "Lights! Camera! Action!" I had a strong suspicion of this after seven semesters pursuing a B.F.A. in Film and Media Arts and a minor in Arts Management, but it was never so fully confirmed than during my 2019 summer internship at Valiant Pictures, a boutique production company in downtown Manhattan where I experienced firsthand the detailed preparation and hard work required to produce commercials, shorts and feature films. In the office, I read pre-production books, treatments and scripts, and also assisted with editing. On set, I worked as a PA [production assistant] on four commercials and as a second camera assistant on a short film. Beyond general know-how and professional set etiquette, I received advice from my supervisors, including DIT [digital imaging technician] recommendations and tips on how to pitch a script. I'm thankful to have had this opportunity to explore NYC's film scene, learn the day-to-day of production and apply professionalism to my projects." Maci Mallahan (B.A. Film & Media Arts, B.A. Markets and Culture ’19 [Dec.]) During fall semester 2017 I interned at the Dallas Film Society (DFS) in the Educational Outreach department. DFS is a nonprofit organization, and part of what they do is set up workshops and Q&As for high school students in the Dallas area. I was responsible for keeping up with which schools would be attending the events. I also helped put on the events and learned from each speaker. DFS also puts on screenings for the public and I helped the team introduce two of the screenings that semester. One was a screening of “Bram Stoker’s Dracula” (1992) for DFS members. At the screening I was introduced to James V. Hart, who wrote the screenplay and the scripts for “Hook,” “Contact,” “August Rush” and many more. He grew up in the same city as me and graduated from SMU. While interning with the Dallas Film Society, they helped me realize there are more careers in film besides being behind the camera.

Hart, right; fellow Dallas Film Society intern, center.] Natalie Khraish B.A. Film and Media Arts ’17 “In summer 2016 I was chosen by the department to be an intern for AFI’s Directing Workshop for Women in Los Angeles. I was also informed of the generous donation I would receive to help pay for my travel and lodging expenses. I can say without a doubt that it was the best experience of my life. I got to work on several different independent film sets, meet and learn from industry professionals, and explore and live in Los Angeles – one of the most amazing cities in the world. This internship allowed me to observe and also be a part of some of the most intricate and professional film sets I have ever seen. I met so many people and made invaluable connections that will surely help me enter the industry once I graduate.” Lawrence Jiang B.F.A. Film & Media Arts; B.B.A. Management ’17 “During summer 2016 I interned at WWE Studios in L.A. I gained exposure to the several stages of production, from reading and analyzing scripts for prospective projects to observing editors put together different cuts for feature films. Through my internship at WWE Studios, I learned how to work in a professional movie studio, became better acquainted with getting around in L.A., and gained insight into what job positions to pursue after graduation. Prior to doing the internship I took Media Career Preparation, which helped me prepare an impressive résumé and cover letter that helped me land this internship.” [Lawrence also held an internship with the American Pavilion at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival.] Janay Higgins B.A in Interdisciplinary Studies ’17 “During summer 2016 I had the opportunity to intern at charlieuniformtango – Dallas in their audio department. During my time there I worked on several projects for companies like American Airlines, Choctaw Nation and Johnson Brothers. Some of my responsibilities were assisting in recording sessions and with editing/mixing audio in Pro Tools. From this experience I gained necessary skills and learned best practices used in the audio field. My courses in Meadows gave me the experience and knowledge needed to hit the ground running on the projects and in my career.” Kim Kooker B.A. Film & Media Arts; B.B.A. Marketing ’17 During fall 2015 of my junior year I had the amazing opportunity to intern at The Levenson Group on their Paramount Pictures, CBS Films and Warner Bros. accounts. My duties included planning local promotional events, staffing advanced screenings, distributing promotional materials and partnering with local businesses to promote the films. I handled the grassroots promotions for about 10 films and gained valuable insight into the field marketing strategies of three very different studios. The most important thing I learned from the experience was that you can be an integral part of the marketing and release of a film by working on the ground level in a large city like Dallas - you don't necessarily have to be in L.A. (Photo from Wicklow National Park in Ireland during the summer when Kim studied abroad in London.) Samantha Doctor B.A. Film & Media Arts ’17 During summer 2015 I interned for Paramount Pictures within their World Wide Marketing group. During my nine weeks working in L.A., I gained exposure to qualitative marketing research, presentations made for marketing strategy, and editing print and video advertising content. The program offered seminars on how the entertainment industry works within a large studio. The entire experience gave me a huge perspective on which avenues I would like to pursue, and a fun summer in a new city! By working with Meadows faculty, I was given the tools and alumni connections to land this great opportunity. Journalism Sara Magalio B.A. Journalism, B.F.A. Dance Performance ’19 In the fall 2018 semester, I worked as a breaking news reporter for The Dallas Morning News. I published numerous articles covering a range of topics, from Dallas crime to the Texas State Fair. This internship challenged me to complete stories on a tight deadline, while also allowing me to become acclimated to working in a professional newsroom. In the spring 2019 semester, I worked as an online editorial assistant for D Magazine. D challenged me to complete lengthier, more thoroughly researched pieces. I specifically covered politics and urban development in Dallas. Both of these internship opportunities have given me invaluable, professional experience in the field that I feel will greatly help me in my future career. Cassidy Najarian B.A. Journalism; B.A. Advertising/Digital Media ’19 [Dec.] In spring of 2019, I worked as a breaking news reporter for The Dallas Morning News. Working at a major newspaper sharpened my writing and communication skills and gave me hands-on experience in a fast-paced environment. A lot of my stories are centered around crime and I often had to analyze police reports or call local police stations to get information. This type of work made me step outside my comfort zone and ultimately made me a better journalist. Maddie Church (B.A. Fashion Media, minor in advertising ’19) “As an intern at Seacrest Studios for the Red Balloon Network at Children’s Health hospital, I gained valuable experience working in broadcast journalism and programming at a multimedia center. During this time, I developed skills in operating the TriCaster and soundboard, as well as hosting on-air radio and game shows. The program is broadcast directly to TVs in every patient’s room to provide entertainment, especially to those who cannot leave their room. It has been a very rewarding experience knowing that I can make a difference doing something I love. This internship has solidified my passion for broadcast journalism and has equipped me with the necessary tools to further explore the industry.” Kelly Kolff (B.A. Journalism, minors in art history and in advertising ’18 [Dec.]) “Spoke Media was single handedly the best internship I’ve ever had to further my journalistic career. From my first day, I was involved in nearly every step of the show creation process. For the summer and fall of 2018, I had the privilege of being a production assistant at Spoke Media, a podcasting company in downtown Dallas. I have always desired to work in the podcasting field and through the day-to-day tasks assigned to me, I mastered the foundation that will help me succeed going forward. Specifically, I had the immense pleasure of working on a podcast dealing with the death of an absent father. Not only did I learn valuable techniques, but also I was challenged to grow emotionally. I was challenged to rise to this professional level, however I feel like I overcame my obstacles and grew in educational, professional and emotional ways.” Morgan Chandler Smith B.A. Journalism ’18 “I had the privilege of interning for Zanna Roberts Rassi, senior fashion editor at Marie Claire Magazine in New York, stylist for Target, and correspondent for E! News and The Today Show. My typical day consisted of assisting with styling on the set of photo and video shoots and researching fashion trends for Zanna’s segments (I even wrote her red carpet questions for the CFDA awards!). The experience provided clarity for my future, both personally and professionally. Working for one of the most influential people in fashion connected me with stylists and businesspeople that I wouldn’t have met otherwise. The glitz and glamour does wear off, but living in the moment and going in with a willingness to learn and experience as much as you can makes every day as good as it can be.” [Morgan also interned her junior year at D CEO magazine.] Macye Marshall B.A. Journalism ’18 “Interning at Seacrest Studios for the Red Balloon Network at Children’s Health hospital was such a rewarding experience. I served as a radio and TV host, worked the TriCaster system and audio board, and set up the visual set before we went live. Not only did I gain further experience that will make me a capable asset in an active news environment, I was also able to impact the lives of the patients and their families who have been hospitalized for long periods of time. While serving as an on-air host of my own radio and television show, the kids became more outgoing and realized how special they are! Using the studio’s professional audio and video broadcast equipment would not have been easy without the help from my Meadows professors. The first day going live I was confident due to all the time and dedication my professors gave me to do my best.” Patrick Engel B.A. Journalism ’17 “I’ve had plenty of great journalism experiences at SMU, but I didn’t work in a newsroom until I spent the summer of 2016 at FOX4 in Dallas as a web producer intern. I wrote news stories for the station’s website, fox4news.com. My writing speed and story organization skills improved a lot, but the most valuable part for me was working the day after the July 7 police shootings in Dallas. That experience showed me how “real” the coverage was and how important professional coverage is to breaking news. To experience and be part of the coverage was incredible. Through my internship I was guided by SMU alum Mark Norris, the station’s senior web producer.” India Pougher B.A. Journalism, B.A. Fashion Media ’17 “Working in the beauty closet at Marie Claire in New York City, I learned the ins and outs of magazine production, as well as the beauty and fashion industries. Throughout the summer I took part in writing, reporting, market work, social media production and other creative projects, and interacted with editors across multiple departments. With encouragement and advice from fashion media professors Camille Kraeplin and Jayne Suhler I embarked on one of the best experiences of my life. This internship solidified my desire to work in fashion media after graduation, and has put me so much closer to that goal.” [Copy and paste to see India’s journalism and fashion media website: https://indiapougher.wordpress.com] Natalia Bru B.A. Journalism ’17 "My whole life I've had one goal: to run/produce late night television. When I interned at "Entertainment Tonight" and "The Insider" with CBS in L.A., I was introduced to Stephen Colbert by "The Insider" host Louis Aguirre. Colbert told me to never give up on my dreams and to strive for excellence. He got to meet David Letterman, who told him maybe one day he would be taking over Letterman's chair ... and he did! My summer wouldn't have been possible without the guidance and help of professors Michele Houston and Pam Harris Hackett. They both push me to do my best." [Natalia also interned at “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” in summer 2016.] Ashley Almquist B.A. Journalism ’16 "I interned at CBS Television Studios for "Entertainment Tonight" and "The Insider" in Studio City, Calif. I got to work on all aspects of production for both shows. I transcribed interviews, ran scripts to talent, prepared post-shoot updates, gathered content for the shows and even acted as production assistant at the 2015 Teen Choice Awards. This summer was a great experience because the journalism professors had really prepared me for this opportunity." [Ashley is now a social media manager for the APA Agency in Beverly Hills.] Music Greg Eckhardt M.M. in Musicology ’20 "When I try to explain to someone what musicology is, I tend to say that I "read and write about music." While this is true, I often leave out the many steps that go into becoming a musicologist. Presenting at conferences is just one of these steps. In the past year I've had the opportunity to present at three different conferences, including the New England chapter of the American Musicological Society. Presenting at conferences yields a variety of experiences, most notably the connections one makes when at an event such as this one. This journey will continue as my graduate career continues, but without the support I've received from my professors at Meadows I wouldn't be where I am today. Teaching me the skills that I need to succeed has proved paramount in this academic journey." [In spring 2020 Eckhardt presented a paper at the University of North Texas GAMuT Student Conference on Gustav Mahler and Alfred Roller's 1903-07 Vienna Court Opera productions.] Nicolas Farmer B.M. Composition/Horn Performance ’20 "In July 2019, I attended the Analysis, Creation, and Teaching of Orchestration Conference at IRCAM in Paris, France. At the sponsorship of former Meadows Musicology Professor Zachary Wallmark, and in addition to networking with many composers and musicologists, I presented my research on the esoteric orchestration techniques Alexander Scriabin used in his late orchestral music and how they influenced later composers in the early 20th century. At the conference I received valuable feedback on my ongoing research, and I am grateful for the opportunity to pursue a research interest of mine beyond composition and horn during my undergraduate career at Meadows." Julia Baca B.M. Performance/Viola, B.M. Music Education ’20 “As a musician, I’ve always found it important to be familiar with as many aspects of a performance as possible. A lot must happen before a performance entertains an audience, and this internship has shown me how successful an institution can be at building relationships with its patrons and producing high-quality publications with limited time, while maintaining professionalism and passion for the task at hand. As an intern, I had the privilege of contributing ideas and edits to the annual program book, season brochure, social media initiatives and first-ever television commercial. This unforgettable summer has allowed me to contribute to the many successes at the Santa Fe Opera and further cemented my passion for yet another part of the music industry.” Abigail Hawthorne B.M. Performance/Oboe, B.A. Psychology ’18 “In summer 2017, I played with the National Repertory Orchestra in Breckenridge, Colo. Over the course of eight weeks, we performed in 21 full orchestra concerts as well as smaller-scale chamber music outreach events in the beautiful Summit County community. I learned so much through my collaboration with music director Carl Topilow, guest conductors, and my talented colleagues within the orchestra. We played fantastic programs of pieces from the standard classical music repertoire, as well as popular music programs including patriotic music for the Fourth of July, the music of “Star Wars,” and family concerts aimed toward introducing children to the instruments of the orchestra. I had a wonderful summer and grew so much as a musician and artistic community member!” [Photo: Abigail, left, with members of the NRO oboe section.] Mary Lena Bleile B.M. Performance/Cello ’18 “I'm a student researcher in Meadows’ MuSci Cognition Lab. I got the wonderful opportunity to attend the Methods in Empirical Music Research workshop at Ohio State University, where I learned from one of America's leading musicologists! Dr. David Huron's workshop was incredibly inspiring and informative, something that definitely helped develop my skills and expand my breadth of knowledge of current research. It was also such a pleasure to be around the 14 other like-minded workshop attendees. I'd highly recommend this workshop to anyone interested in empirical music research.” Isaiah Pennington B.M. Performance/Cello ’18 "As a member of Bridge the Gap Chamber Players (BTG), I have witnessed the small student-run nonprofit transform into a strong force for arts advocacy in Dallas due to the hard work of dedicated Meadows students. We have been able to help start a youth orchestra for underprivileged students in South Dallas, forming a close relationship with the kids we teach and the community where we work. Meadows is invaluable at preparing its students for the kind of entrepreneurial and pedagogical work BTG does. The faculty at Meadows equip students with the kind of real-world skills needed to create a thriving arts organization and personal career.” [Photo: Isaiah with students at Dunbar Elementary.] Alexis Nguyen B.M. Music Education ’17 “In the summer of 2016, I was the Operations Intern and House Manager for Music@Menlo, a Chamber Music Festival and Institute, in Menlo Park/Atherton, California. I absolutely loved my time in the Bay Area. I was able to network with not only Music@Menlo artists but also people interning from around the globe. By working closely with the administrative staff, production crew and artists, I gained hands-on experience running a festival. The high quality of musicianship, professionalism and overall rigor of the Meadows School prepares its students for this field of work.” Nilsa Pozo B.M. Music Therapy ’17 In summer 2016 I researched the uses of music therapy to support individuals in their weight loss efforts by working with a group of 11 women in a private medical office in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Each week I led group sessions to address behavioral and emotional barriers to weight loss and provide 30 minutes of drumming and exercise. The experience challenged me to use every musical and therapeutic skill I have learned from my professors in the MUTY program. It was immensely rewarding to see how the interventions motivated participants to take control of the weight loss process and enjoy it at the same time. The results of the study have inspired me to improve my clinician skills and conduct further research on this topic. Vinnie Mahal B.M. Vocal Performance ’17 Last spring I had the wonderful opportunity to collaborate with the Voices of Change chamber music ensemble on "Tibet Fantasia," composed by SMU Associate Professor of Music Composition and Theory Xi Wang. It was a wonderful but very challenging experience as I had never before sung any modern classical music. It challenged my musicianship abilities, but getting to work with Dr. Xi and Professor of Voice Virginia Dupuy helped me immensely. Professor Dupuy taught me valuable lessons in vocal technique, pitch reference and the importance of preparation in the professional world. For that, I am very grateful. Moretta Irchirl B.M. Music Therapy, B.M. Vocal Performance ’16 The Music Therapy program has given me the great honor of working at My Possibilities, a continuing education facility for adults with disabilities. Each week, I do one-on-one and group music therapy sessions with the HIPsters (Highly Important People) to help improve their everyday life skills. It is an amazing experience to see them function at a higher level when participating in personalized musical activities. With this hands-on experience, I am learning and implementing new therapeutic techniques that I will use for the rest of my career as a music therapist. Lawson Malnory B.M. Music Education ’17 The motivational environment created by Meadows inspiring professors led me to found my own nonprofit, Helping Hand Drums. Meadows has equally inspiring students, such as those who lead and allow me to be a part of Bridge the Gap Chamber Players, which brings great student musicians out to the community, and the South Dallas Strings project, a music education program for elementary students in South Dallas. Meadows is a great place to learn how to"do more" with your craft than just perform on stage or hang something on a wall. You learn how to build the stage, and make the wall, and bring it to the community. [In addition to serving as the president of Dallas’s Bridge the Gap Chamber Players, Lawson also interned with the Dallas Symphony Orchestra in 2016 and 2017.] Theatre Josh Whittington-Manning M.F.A. in Design ’21 "I had the honor of collaborating with Lindsay Silva (M.F.A. '19) on a number of shows she designed for Jubilee Theater in Fort Worth, Texas. Assisting her was such a treat because it brought me two opportunities: One, we have very different styles, so I got to learn new lighting design techniques from her, many of which I would have never considered on my own. Two, I was able to broaden my network by working with the artistic director, director and other designers at Jubilee. Working with Lindsay and the Jubilee accelerated my development as a designer." Janice Rabian M.F.A. in Design ’21 "I was the assistant costume designer on Public Works Dallas 2019 working with NYC-based costume designer Lex Liang, who designed costumes for over 100 cast members. I helped create the design of the production. Lex was a wonderful mentor, and gave me a lot of creative freedom and leadership opportunities. I worked closely with the equity actors and community members in fittings and during the tech process. I also worked as an associate costume designer to Professor Claudia Stephens on Cape Fear Regional Theatre's production of "Mamma Mia!" I led creative discussions and collaborated with the CFRT team, the NYC director and NYC choreographer to create a fresh and modern take on this '90s jukebox classic. I led the production process, working closely with the shop manager and professional actors to fit the production. The production was fabulous and sparkly and I walked away from the experience with a great portfolio piece and a new professional network." Stakiah Washington B.F.A. Theatre Studies ’21 I had the honor of going to New York City to be in the Stella Adler Black Art Intensive. The six-week intensive took place at the legendary Billie Holiday Theatre in Brooklyn. Besides making lifelong friends, I also had the opportunity to network with well-known actors. Several of the workshops included scene study, monologue work, African dancing, wellness and mental health for artists, music, playwriting and business management in the theatre industry. I had the opportunity of being trained by Ruben Santiago-Hudson, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Michele Shay, Harry Lennix and many more. Through this program I have gained great knowledge and understanding of myself, my craft and those who have come before me. Rose Cobey M.F.A. in Design ’20 “I was a lighting intern at Cincinnati Opera—the second-oldest opera company in the U.S.—over the course of the five-show season. During that time, I worked with Thomas Hase, a truly world-famous opera designer, as an intern, second assistant and assistant lighting designer (ALD). It was an exceptional opportunity to experience a prestigious opera company from the inside out, as well as to work with one of the best in the business. My duties were wide-ranging, including traditional ALD tasks such as drafting light plots, as well as unexpected responsibilities such as handling quotes and bids from suppliers. The internship focused almost as much on running a department as it did on design. The most memorable part was working as Thomas’s ALD on a brand-new opera called ‘Blind Injustice,’ commissioned by Cincinnati Opera and based on the Ohio Innocence Project.” Bri Tobin M.F.A. in Design ’20 "My fellowship at the Hangar Theatre in Ithaca, New York, really kickstarted my design career! In the span of a few months I participated in the Hangar’s competitive “design boot camp,” designing two children’s plays, two experimental plays in a shared art space, and assisting New York City designers on three productions. The first few weeks were rigorous as we had a short time to collaborate and pitch full designs to the company’s artistic director. To accomplish this, we roomed in a communal living space with our design teams and directing fellows. It was such a unique and fun experience to collaborate day and night with other young professionals. One of the most rewarding parts of the fellowship was the opportunity to workshop with eight successful designers whose credits ranged from Broadway to international opera houses. The fellowship was intense, but I will never forget the skills and confidence I gained!" Coda Boyce B.F.A. Theatre/Acting ’20 I attended SpringboardNYC with The American Theatre Wing, a program that introduces theatre students to life in New York City. I learned what it was like to thrive as an actor and pursue the career I was meant for. I attended nine Broadway productions and the Tony Awards! I talked with well-known actors such as Jeremy Pope, Cynthia Erivo, Patti LuPone, and LaTanya Richardson Jackson, who gave some very encouraging advice. We worked all day at Pearl Studios, only blocks away from amazing theatres. We took the subway every morning (the MTA is not your friend), attended workshops and master classes all day, and ended our nights with a show. SpringboardNYC teaches you that the work never stops after graduation, you must keep perfecting your craft by taking classes and seeing shows and going out for auditions. I built so many connections at this program that not only am I excited but I’m also incredibly prepared to make my journey to the Big Apple in 2020. Yvonne Johnson (M.F.A. Stage Design ’20) “My internship through the Television Academy in Los Angeles for costume design was one of the most epic experiences of my life! I was assigned to Bill Hargate Costumes, the facility that builds the costumes for Marvel as well as for ‘American Horror Story,’ DC’s ‘Superman,’ the new Quentin Tarantino film starring Brad Pitt and a host of other film, television and theatre productions. I got to go on set and see them film the last episode of ‘Strange Angel,’ a CBS streaming show, attend Comic-Con in San Diego where I met Ruth Carter, the costume designer of Marvel’s ‘Black Panther,’ and went costume shopping with Michelle Cole, Emmy-nominated costume designer for ABC’s ‘Black-ish.’ The Television Academy also held networking events for around 60 interns that included a behind-the-scenes experience with HBO’s ‘Game of Thrones’ process. I made some great connections and even received an invitation to the Creative Arts Emmy awards! I can’t wait to go back and see all my idols receive recognition for their great work and hope to one day get to stand in their shoes.” [Photo: Yvonne Johnson, left, with Ruth E. Carter, costume designer of Marvel’s “Black Panther.” Carter is also known for her costume designs for “Malcolm X,” “Roots” (TV series), “Amistad,” “Selma” and multiple additional television shows and films.] Kassy Amoi B.F.A. Theatre ’18 “In my work for Ignite/Arts Dallas, I collaborated with Public Works Dallas as a teacher's assistant and company member of the Dallas Theatre Center 2017 production of ‘The Tempest.’ The production involved over 150 actors from throughout the Dallas community and was a collaboration between SMU Meadows, Ignite/Arts Dallas and Dallas Theater Center, in affiliation with New York City’s The Public Theater’s Public Works and Dallas’s AT&T Performing Arts Center. I continue to work for Ignite/Arts Dallas as both a student and artist to learn more about my community in the most fulfilling way possible. The lessons I learn never disappoint me.” Leslie Ballart B.F.A. Theatre/Acting ’17 “I worked with Public Works Dallas as a community liaison during “The Tempest” at Dallas Theater Center. This was an incredible opportunity to connect with community members from various backgrounds. I worked with people who never thought they would be involved in a professional production along with those who’ve been theater professionals for most of their lives. Helping non-English speaking cast members by using my first language, Spanish -- which I hadn’t utilized in-depth in a long time -- was extremely gratifying. This experience has opened my eyes and heart to the extraordinary power of theatre. Watching others achieve their dreams, face new challenges and inspire their community has in turn inspired me to go after my own dreams once I graduate, and reconfirmed why I love theatre.” Christina Sittser B.F.A. Theatre/Theatre Studies ’17 (Minors in: Fashion Media, European Studies, History of Visual & Performing Arts) “I was an actress and assistant teaching artist for Public Works Dallas, and boy was it a great experience! I got to teach acting classes at two community centers, and my students were so much fun. Then, together with professionals from Dallas Theater Center and over 150 other Dallasites, we put on a beautiful production of Shakespeare’s “The Tempest.” On our last day, I felt like my heart was being ripped out because I’d made so many friends. It’s okay, though, because we’ve kept in touch! That was my seventh professional theatre job while enrolled at SMU. Who knew I’d feel this ready to graduate and get out there?!” (Photo by Susan Hamilton) Haley Nelson B.F.A. Theatre/Theatre Studies ’17 "My liberal arts and theatre classes were equally important during my internship at the Ko Festival in Amherst, Massachusetts. I worked on solo performances and devised theatre pieces, many of which focused on social justice issues including urban violence, mass incarceration and the refugee crisis. My non-theatre classes helped me converse knowledgeably about these issues in the rehearsal room with an international cast and crew, and my playwriting, solo performance and tech classes allowed me to assume technical roles and script development opportunities with ease. My internship combined my passions for theatre and politics, and taught me about successfully producing touring theatre." Diggle M.F.A. in Design ’16 I am the primary scenic associate for Clint Ramos, a Broadway scenic and costume designer. Together, we have collaborated on over 13 productions. Most recently, we opened "Slave Play" on Broadway and we are about to open another Broadway show, "Grand Horizons." Working as his associate designer has not only propelled my knowledge as a designer but has acted as a catalyst for my own design career. I am now a union designer in the IATSE Scenic Artist Union Local 829 and I am represented by an agent at Abrams Artists Agency. Tiana Johnson M.F.A. Acting ’16 "Working in the Dallas area with professional theater companies such as Dallas Theater Center has given me the opportunity to gain professional experience and a chance to meet fellow actors working within the community. It presents me with many options of what a career in the arts could look like and connections that will launch me into my career. SMU Meadows has prepared me to know what is expected of me when I step into a room under the title of an actor or an artist." Sasha Davis B.F.A. Theatre Studies ’16 "I had great experiences working with a national Dallas Faces Race conference, which focuses on shifting the racial imbalance in our country. Playwrights from nine Dallas theatre companies wrote 10-minute plays based off a prompt about the Trayvon Martin shooting. I served as production manager for the readings as well as an actor and was paid for both. The plays were later produced at the Kitchen Dog Theatre, which was founded by SMU alums, three of whom I've been lucky enough to call my teachers. Both experiences exposed me to a completely different side of theatre that is very different from acting; both introduced me to wonderful artists in the greater Dallas area." Dylan Guerra B.F.A Theater ’16 "I worked with the Dallas Theater Center as an assistant director on the play "The School for Wives" by Moliere. Through this experience I gained knowledge and hands-on experience on directing in the professional world. I also learned how to run a rehearsal room and work with not only actors, but also designers and crew. My classes in Meadows really prepared me for the challenges in directing at a professional theater and I always felt prepared and ready for whatever task I needed to perform. After working with DTC, I now have several connections and perhaps even job opportunities when I graduate and have no doubt I will be able to practice my craft in the real world."

Mustang Transfers Tau Sigma National Honors Society Contact Us Contact Us Transfer Student Services Staff ☰ Enrollment Services Transfer Students How Credits Transfer How Credits Transfer SMU offers tools to help you determine how credits will transfer, as well as to assist with course selection at your current institution to meet SMU core and major requirements. The Equivalency Course Tool helps you create a transfer report to see what courses transfer. If SMU has a corresponding course to one you've taken, the SMU course equivalency is listed. Transferable courses for which there is no exact SMU equivalent are awarded elective credit and given an "XX", "YY" or other generic course number. Transfer Pathway Guides for the Common Curriculum and specific majors suggest courses and term plans to keep you on track to meet requirements at SMU. Guides for scholarships, financial aid, international students and veterans are also available. When planning your move to SMU, keep the following transfer policies in mind: Official college transcripts are required for ALL college-level work attempted, regardless of transferability. University policy requires that of the 120 minimum required term hours for a degree, at least 48-60 hours must be earned in residence at SMU. Within this framework, all students must complete SMU's Common Curriculum and at least one major in order to earn an undergraduate degree. If you are currently attending a college or university on the quarter system, your course credits will be converted to semester credits. Quarter hours are converted to semester hours by multiplying by two-thirds (0.67000). If you are unsure what type of credit system your institution follows, refer to the transcript legend on your transcript or your institution's catalog or website. Transfer Credit FAQs Partnership Programs with SMU CC Transfer Students DCCCD Transfer Students McLennan Transfer Students TCCD Transfer Students Transfer Pathway Guides Transfer Pathway Guides are helpful tools which allow you to easily match your transfer coursework with requirements at SMU. These guides provide information on admission procedures and requirements, academic programs, and course conversions. A degree from SMU is typically comprised of a minimum of 120 hours, 60 of which must be completed in residence at SMU. Components of the degree include: Courses in your major Courses required for the Common Curriculum (CC) Elective courses. These electives may also be used to add a second major or minor. Use these comprehensive Transfer Pathway Guides to identify courses which satisfy these three components for a smooth transition to SMU. Informational guides for financial aid, international students, veterans, the University Honors Program and merit scholarships are also available. University Honors Program SMU's University Honors Program (UHP) allows highly engaged and motivated students of all majors to enhance their academic experience at SMU by satisfying the University Curriculum in small, discussion-based honors classes. In addition to these classes, UHP students participate in an honors community that offers a full calendar of optional honors events including lectures, field trips, book discussions, lunches, and dinners. Fellowships are also available for independent research. Students who complete the UHP graduate with honors from the University. In order to participate in SMU's UHP, you must have a transferable GPA of 3.7. A short application process is required. Click here for an information sheet. Contact your admissions counselor for an application. Transfer Planning As a prospective transfer student, you are assigned an admission counselor to help you understand SMU's requirements and procedures, explore academic interests, clarify academic expectations, and prepare you for your transfer to SMU. Long-range planning is the key to success. Our degree programs are designed to give you flexibility, as well as the expertise you need to succeed. Start Planning Now Now is the time to start academic planning by reading through the admission requirements and degree requirements in SMU's Undergraduate Catalog. The University Advising Center website is also a valuable tool for familiarizing yourself with academic policies, and exploring what SMU has to offer. Are you Math Ready? What is math readiness, and why is it important to the transfer admission process? As part of SMU's Common Curriculum, you must complete a math fundamentals requirement consisting of one, three-hour math course. Math readiness is an indication you are prepared to satisfy this requirement, if you are not already transferring in a course to meet it. To be "math ready," you must complete college algebra or a high school sequence of Algebra I, Algebra II and Plane Geometry within the last three years to be considered for transfer admission. These courses should prepare you to take one of the SMU math courses when you arrive. SMU does not accept developmental math courses for transfer. Please pay careful attention when choosing math courses at your current institution. If you are choosing a math course for transfer to meet the University Curriculum math requirements, check your institution's course descriptions against the SMU's Course Descriptions. SMU Admission staff is available to help with any questions you may have. Please contact your Transfer Admission Counselor. Transfer Credit Evaluation Once your transcripts are received at SMU, your coursework will be evaluated, and a Transfer Evaluation Report will be created. You will want to review the Transfer Evaluation Report carefully to confirm that the evaluation is accurate. Standards for Official Transcripts Official college transcripts are required for all college-level work attempted, regardless of transferability. To be considered "official," transcripts must be received at SMU directly from the transferable institution. A transcript issued to you is acceptable by SMU provided it is received in a sealed, letterhead envelope with the Registrar’s Office stamp. SMU only accepts electronic transcripts sent from the transferable institution. We will not accept electronic transcripts sent by students. Transcripts must be dated fewer than three years prior to processing. Coursework from one institution which appears on an official transcript from another institution will not be accepted for transfer credit. An official transcript must be issued by each institution attended. Also, copies of transcripts provided by other institutions are not acceptable. For standards applied to transcripts issued by non-U.S. institutions, see our International Transfer Students page. If you are transferring from a U.S. institution(s), send your transcripts to: Office of Undergraduate Admissions SMU P.O. Box 750181 Dallas, TX 75275-0181 Electronic transcripts from the transferable institution via a secure means (e.g., Scrip-Safe, NSC, GreenLight) should be sent to ugadmission@smu.edu. If you are transferring from a foreign institution(s), have your transcripts and related documents sent to: The International Center SMU 6185 Airline Road, Suite 216 Dallas, TX 75205 USA If you are a current SMU student, have your transcripts sent to: University Registrar SMU P.O. Box 750181 Dallas, TX 75275-0181 Electronic transcripts from the transferable institution via a secure means (e.g., Scrip-Safe, NSC, GreenLight) should be sent to ugadmission@smu.edu. Transfer Evaluation Report What is the Transfer Evaluation Report? The Transfer Evaluation Report (TER) is a comprehensive report of how your college work will transfe­r to SMU. The TER includes the transfer G.P.A. and a detailed list of every course you enrolled in at other universities or colleges. The list shows which courses have been approved for SMU credit, and also the reasons why other courses were deemed non-transferable. How does SMU determine which courses transfer? Official college transcripts are required for all college-level work attempted before you enter SMU, regardless of whether or not those courses are approved for transfer credit. SMU accepts most college-level academic credits earned with grades of “C-“ or better. The courses must be from a regionally accredited institution, acceptable in content, and comply with all other SMU transfer policies. Transferable courses are used to determine your Transferable G.P.A., which is then reviewed by counselors for admission to SMU and for transfer student scholarship consideration. The Transfer G.P.A. is based on all transferable coursework. The last grade prior to matriculation in repeated courses where the original grade was a "F" or "D" is used in the Transferable G.P.A calculation. Coursework attempted in another college's conditional or probationary program is also used. College-level courses taken at another institution, but not offered at SMU, may receive generic course numbers or free-elective transfer credit. These courses must have been completed with a grade of “C-“ or better at regionally accredited colleges or universities that meet SMU standards. Courses in this category include number designations ending in “XX”, “YY”, “U1”, “U2”, etc. Why are courses not approved for transfer credit? If a course is determined to be non-transferable, a code corresponding to the reason for that determination is noted on the right side of the report. Explanations of those codes are listed in the table below. Non-Transferable Code on Code Descriptions Transfer Evaluation Report NTCN Course does not meet SMU standards for content NTPL Course does not satisfy SMU academic policies NTXX Further information is needed to evaluate the course NTVO Course is vocational or technical NTRE Course is below college level or remedial (e.g., Developmental English, math, and reading courses; ESL courses) Course completed with a grade below a "C-", a Withdrawal, or a course in NTGR progress (IP) (Note: Although the course is non-transferable, a grade below C- will be calculated into the all-college G.P.A. and will affect admission eligibility) Transferable GPA All grades for transferable courses are used to calculate the transfer GPA. Courses with a grade of D or F are not transferable to SMU for credit, however the grades are calculated into the transfer GPA. Exceptions are made for repeated courses where the grades in the first attempts were D+ or lower. In these cases, only grades in the last attempts of the repeated courses prior to matriculation at SMU are used to calculate the transfer GPA, even if lower. To qualify for the transfer grade replacement, courses must be repeated at the same institution in which the original grade was earned or carry the same course number based on a statewide course numbering system. For repeated courses where the grade in the first attempt was a C- or higher, all grades will be used to calculate the transfer GPA but credit will be awarded for only the first successful attempt. A grade of W (Withdrawn) is not used to calculate the transferable GPA. A grade of I (Incomplete) or a missing grade is calculated as F. A grade of IP (In Progress) for a current term is not calculated. This grade replacement policy for eligible transfer courses will be used in all transfer and all-college GPA calculations and other academic determinations at SMU. For some majors requiring a subset of courses and specific GPAs for entry, the subset GPA is calculated using the first graded attempt of these courses, even if the first attempt of the course was failed or later repeated. Transfer course grades are not calculated in major/minor GPAs. Generic Department Elective Credit Generic elective credit for transferable courses for which there is no exact SMU equivalent are given an "XX", "YY," “U1,” or “U2” designation. Free Elective Transfer Credit Free elective transfer credit (FETC) is awarded to courses not taught at SMU. FETC may be awarded for appropriate courses completed with a grade of C- or better at regionally accredited colleges or universities that meet SMU's academic standards. Credit for Courses “Passed” SMU accepts the grade of "Pass" for transfer courses as long as the grading scale used at the awarding institution awards a P for courses passed with a C- or better. For example, if the transferring institution defines "P" as passing with a C- or better, then SMU will evaluate the course as a "P" and award credit. SMU students are limited to a total of 12 hours of Pass credits. This includes grades earned for accepted transfer courses. This requirement cannot be waived. Courses that do NOT transfer to SMU Courses below college level (e.g. Developmental English, Math and Reading courses; ESL courses) Vocational - Technical courses including Workforce Education courses PE activity courses in excess of two hours Correspondence courses Courses completed at a school that is not regionally accredited Courses with a grade below a "C-" (Note: Although the course is non-transferable, the grade received below a C- will count towards a student's admission eligibility and is calculated into his/her all-college GPA, which is used when calculating Latin degree honors at graduation time.) Credit by examination earned at another college or university Please note: If a course on your Transfer Evaluation Report receives an evaluation of NTCN and you believe it should transfer, please email transfer@smu.edu for a second review. Academic Forgiveness SMU allows students to dismiss coursework taken 10 or more years prior to the term of admission. These courses are not considered part of your admission review and are not included in the calculation of your transferable GPA or hours earned for transfer to SMU. Applicants must submit official transcripts and SMU's Academic Forgiveness Form along with all other required application materials at the time of admission to receive academic forgiveness.

Early Decision Skip to main content SMU Explore SMU Academics Student Affairs About SMU News Events Calendar Research George W. Bush Presidential Center Current Students Alumni Information for Faculty & Staff Apply to SMUGIVE NOW Undergraduate Admission Apply Visit Financial Aid Menu Search Apply First Year Early Decision Early Decision First Year Dates and Deadlines Early Decision Testing Admission Requirements Class Profile International Students Homeschool Students Request Information Self-Reported Test Scores Additional applicant types Choosing the decision plan that's right for you. What is the difference between Early Decision and Early Action? Early Decision is a binding agreement that requires you to withdraw all other applications and attend SMU if admitted, provided you are offered sufficient financial assistance. Early Action, on the other hand, is a non-binding program. If admitted in Early Action, you are not obligated to withdraw all other applications, and can still choose which school you wish to attend. While the Early Action deadline and notification dates are earlier than Regular Decision, you have until the national reply deadline of May 1 to decide whether or not you wish to attend SMU. Who should apply Early Decision I? Students who identify SMU as their top choice college prior to November 1 are encouraged to apply Early Decision I. If admitted, students are expected to enroll and immediately withdraw all other applications. Who should apply Early Decision II? Students who identify SMU as their top choice college after November 1 but before January 15 are encouraged to apply Early Decision II. In addition, students who believe their application may be more competitive in our process after submitting fall semester grades and/or additional test scores should apply Early Decision II. If admitted, students are expected to enroll and immediately withdraw all other applications. Who should apply Early Action? Students who identify SMU as one of their top choice colleges by November 1 should consider applying Early Action. If admitted, students still have until May 1 to compare offers and respond. How do I apply as an Early Decision candidate? In order to submit an early decision application, students should file an application for admission with the application fee by November 1 for Early Decision I and by January 15 for Early Decision II. Candidates should check the box on the application indicating that they are applying under a binding Early Decision plan and submit the signed Early Decision Agreement Form with the application. Because the Admission Committee releases decisions for Early Decision applicants within 4-6 weeks of the deadline, it is very important that the required information from the guidance/college counselor and teacher be submitted by the stated deadlines. If I am applying to SMU Early Decision, can I apply to another school Early Action? Yes. Students may apply to only one Early Decision program, but this does not prohibit you from applying to another school under a non-binding admission plan. If you are admitted to SMU under the Early Decision plan, you must withdraw all other applications, pay your nonrefundable $685 Orientation, Housing and Matriculation Deposit, and attend SMU. What is the difference between the Early Decision I and Early Decision II plans? The only difference is the dates. Many students make early college visits and know by November that SMU is their first choice school and are able to file an Early Decision I application. Other students apply Early Decision II because their decision to apply early was made after the Early Decision I deadline or because they want the Admission Committee to review new test scores and/or fall term grades as part of their application for admission. When will I receive a decision on my application? Students who apply Early Decision I by the November 1 deadline will be notified of the decision on their application by mail in mid-December. Students who apply Early Decision II by the January 15 deadline will be notified by mail by March 1. While Early Decision candidates may file non-binding applications to other colleges, if they are admitted under one of the Early Decision plans they must immediately withdraw all other applications and enroll at SMU. How do I apply for financial aid as an Early Decision applicant? Students who know they are applying Early Decision to SMU and wish to receive an estimated financial aid award notice must submit prior-year tax returns and register online with the College Scholarship Service and submit the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE® by the Early Decision deadline. You may file the CSS/PROFILE® as early as October 1. You will receive your finalized award notice once you complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), which determines eligibility for state and federal financial aid and the CSS/PROFILE®, which determines eligibility for university need-based aid. The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) priority deadline for Early Decision applicants and all other applicants is February 15. SMU’s FAFSA school code is 003613; the CSS/ PROFILE® code is 6660. Please visit SMU's Office of Financial Aid website for more detailed information about applying for need-based aid and other financial aid deadlines. If I am admitted Early Decision and am applying for financial aid, when will I be notified about my financial aid package? Admitted students who submit prior-year tax returns and register online with the College Scholarship Service and submit the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE® by the Early Decision deadline will receive an estimated aid offer along with their admission packet. This offer is based on information submitted on the College Scholarship Service CSS/PROFILE® form as well as submission of your parents’ prior calendar year tax returns. A final aid offer will follow in the spring, pending receipt of your Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). In the unlikely event that information on your FAFSA varies significantly or your family circumstances have changed significantly from original estimates, your financial aid package may change. Students who do not submit the required financial aid information by the Early Decision application deadline will not receive an estimated award. The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) determines eligibility for federal and state financial aid (found at www.fafsa.ed.gov). The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE® (found at student.collegeboard.org/profile) determines eligibility for university need-based aid. There is a $25 cost for completing the CSS/PROFILE®. Does SMU meet full financial need for ED candidates? SMU seeks to provide the best possible financial aid package for each student in the form of grants, loans, and the Federal Work Study Program. At this time, SMU does not have the ability to guarantee that full need will be met for applicants. Please access and complete our Net Price Calculator, a tool that gives students an early indication of the amounts and types of financial aid for which they may qualify. I am interested in Music, Theatre, Dance, Studio Art, or Film & Media Arts (BFA). Can I apply ED? Yes. Students in areas requiring dual admission -- admission to both SMU and to a specific Meadows division -- may apply ED. Applicants in these areas should carefully note the audition and portfolio submission deadlines. Additionally, students in these areas should note that most artistic scholarship awards are not determined until after all auditions and portfolio reviews have taken place. For additional information please click here. I want to be considered for the President’s Scholars or the Hunt Leadership Scholars. Can I apply ED? You may certainly apply Early Decision I or II if your decision to attend SMU does not depend on being offered one of these scholarships. Separate from the need-based financial aid process, the President’s Scholarship and Hunt Leadership Scholarship selection does not take place until well after the Early Decision process. If your enrollment at SMU depends on being named a President’s Scholar or Hunt Leadership Scholar, we would advise you to not apply under our binding Early Decision options.

Whether you are a student looking for an education or a staff member for SMU, the opportunities to learn, grow, and experience new things is never ending. Everyone here wants to see each other succeed, and that kind of support is simply unmatched. Favorite place on campus: The Hughes-Trigg Student Center is definitely one of my favorite places to hang out in. Since it has been renovated, it has allowed our students to thoroughly enjoy some of the great things SMU has to offer, such as innovative study/meeting spaces and fantastic food options like Panera. I love seeing the students hard at work, hanging out with their friends, or making conversation with some of our Dining Services staff members. If there is any place that can best capture SMU’s vibe, it is the Hughes-Trigg Student Center! Favorite place in Dallas: As someone who was born and raised in Dallas, this is hard! But if I *have* to choose a place, it would probably be Fair Park, because it is home to the famous State Fair of Texas and Big Tex himself! Every year, Dallas is honored to host the Texas State Fair which has an incredible amount of activities and amusement rides- good luck getting to them all! By far the best thing about the Texas State Fair is the good people and GREAT food. What I recommend during your stay in Dallas: There are so many fun and unique things to do in Dallas, such as visiting Deep Ellum or the Perot Museum in the Arts District. What I definitely recommend is visiting the Dallas Arboretum and Botanical Gardens.

Everyone is truly happy and proud to be a part of SMU; it shows daily whether it’s inside the classroom, out and about on campus, or within the nearby businesses and neighborhoods. In a city that’s as large as Dallas, it truly makes you feel at home and have a sense of community on the Hilltop. Favorite place on campus: My favorite place on campus would have to be the Hughes-Trigg Student Center. This is a hub of student life on campus. From housing student organizations and offices, meeting rooms for organizations to meet or students to study, and housing my favorite place – Chick-fil-A, it’s truly buzzing with activity always. Favorite place in Dallas: I would have to say my favorite place in Dallas is the Lower Greenville district. Full of restaurants, local shops, bakeries and more, Lower Greenville is a great way to escape the true hustle and bustle of Dallas and move at a slower place with a great atmosphere. Favorite restaurant near campus: I would have to say my favorite restaurant near campus is Rusty Taco. Only three minutes away from campus, Rusty Taco is a staple in the Dallas area. Offering a variety of delicious taco options, they have something for everyone. I would recommend going for one of the breakfast tacos; a win every time! What I recommend during your stay in Dallas: During your stay in Dallas, I would recommend checking out Klyde Warren Park. Located in downtown Dallas, Klyde Warren Park is an outdoor park that goes over one of our Dallas freeways! It’s a great place to hang out outside and have a picnic or enjoy food from one of the various food trucks, and only a three-minute walk from the Dallas Museum of Art.

Being on campus, you get the sense of how close of a community there is here. Everyone is welcoming and always willing to help. Favorite place on campus: My favorite place on campus has to be Dallas Hall and especially the views outside of the front doors. Dallas Hall is majestic on the inside and takes you back in time because of the historical significance of this building. I imagine the first students of SMU walking to their classes, and it is such a neat feeling. Also, when standing outside the front doors, you get the best view of the campus and the city of Dallas. Favorite place in Dallas: My favorite place in Dallas is White Rock Lake. It is a great place to be outdoors and enjoy some nature while living in the rush of the city. I like to go kayaking and take long walks there to disconnect and get some nice exercise for the week. Favorite restaurant near campus: My favorite restaurant near campus is Velvet taco! I like that they have fusion tacos that allow you to try something new. Of course, you have to try the tater tots too! What I recommend during your stay in Dallas: As a Dallas native, there is so much I can recommend! Dallas has some unique neighborhoods like Deep Ellum and Bishop Arts to explore. Also, there are so many great places to eat. Check out the Trinity Groves area for a diverse lineup of restaurants. I am also a huge Dallas sports fan; if you have the time, go to a Mavs game or Texas Rangers game.

Registration for Music auditions is found within the online Meadows Music Application.

Live On-Campus Auditions On-Campus Audition Details Your Meadows Music Application and audition registration must be submitted by or before 7 days prior to audition date.

We strongly encourage you to plan ahead and check with your transfer admission counselor to ensure that you have satisfied admission requirements. Plan ahead to optimize your possibility of earning a Transfer Scholarship and check out the Transfer Equivalency Guides. Pro Tip: Early Action versus Early Decision SMU application Early Decision is a binding agreement to attend SMU if you are accepted to the university, even if you are not also accepted to the Meadows Music Division. For those who wish to apply by the November 1 “Early” deadline, we recommend that music applicants select “Early Action” instead of “Early Decision.” By applying Early Action, music applicants can keep their options open while expressing strong interest in SMU.

Homeschool Students Skip to main content SMU Explore SMU Academics Student Affairs About SMU News Events Calendar Research George W. Bush Presidential Center Current Students Alumni Information for Faculty & Staff Apply to SMUGIVE NOW Undergraduate Admission Apply Visit Financial Aid Menu Search Apply First Year Homeschool Students Homeschool Students First Year Dates and Deadlines Early Decision Testing Admission Requirements Class Profile International Students Homeschool Students Request Information Self-Reported Test Scores Additional applicant types SMU happily accepts and reviews applications from students attending non-traditional high schools, including homeschools and online high schools. A student who has been home-schooled is subject to the same review as a student applying from a traditional high school (please follow the application instructions). We ask that all home-schooled students complete the Homeschool Supplement. The SMU Admission Committee makes the following additional recommendations for home-schooled students to help them be as competitive as possible in the admission process: Curriculum In our review of applicants, we like to see students challenging themselves academically. Regardless of which curriculum you follow, the committee would like to see, at minimum: Four units of English Three units of mathematics (suggested: Algebra I, Geometry, Algebra II) Three units of science (including two units of laboratory science) Three units of social science Two units of a foreign language (full two-year sequence) Please be aware that students who go above and beyond in the rigor of their academic curriculum generally have an advantage in the admissions process. The average number of core academic courses for an admitted student is 20 units. Official Transcript The admission committee will need something to help us measure your success as a student in your homeschool program. We understand that an official transcript may not be available. If this is the case, please submit a transcript with a consistent grading scheme and/or course descriptions including textbook titles so that we can fully understand your program and what was used to determine proficiency in each academic area. You can use the space provided on the Homeschool Supplement or provide a document in your own format. While not required, it may be beneficial to have your transcript notarized. Recommendation Letters As you will see on our application checklist, a counselor recommendation is required and a teacher recommendation is highly recommended. The counselor recommendation should come from the individual who has coordinated your educational experience and can provide information about the curriculum you used. The teacher recommendation can be completed by a teacher, tutor, or the advisor of an activity in which you participate. If you and your educational coordinator (i.e. “counselor”) feel that your application would be better served through your teacher/tutor recommendation, you are welcome to waive the counselor recommendation by submitting a statement. The wording for this statement can be as follows: I, [Full Name of Educational Coordinator], would like to waive my right to provide a counselor letter of recommendation for [Applicant’s Legal Name] on account that the teacher recommendation letter by [Full Name of Teacher/Tutor] is a better representation of the academic merits of this applicant. Under the terms of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), the applicant has waived his/her right to access the teacher’s recommendation form and letter. We understand that we may not be eligible to review or otherwise inspect the letter of recommendation prior to submission to SMU. Dual-Credit & AP/IB/SAT II Exams Many home-schooled applicants challenge themselves by taking dual-credit courses from local accredited colleges or recommended standardized exams. Because each homeschool experience is different, SAT II subject test and/or AP/IB scores and college-level courses can provide the committee with an additional measure of your ability in core academic subject areas such as English literature, math, and science. We look forward to working with you and reviewing your application for admission. Please feel free to contact Anna Lee Buehn with any homeschool-related questions.
