Speaker: Jordana Confino/Fordham Law School. Lawyers and law students tend to be strivers by both nature and nurture. We set lofty goals and work fastidiously to meet them, certain that achieving “success” will bring us satisfaction. But science shows that this logic is backward. Although we believe success will lead to happiness, the reality is that well-being fuels success and the key building blocks for well-being are not necessarily what you might think. In this session, you will: . . Learn to apply evidence-backed insights and techniques from positive psychology (the science of human flourishing) to effectively manage stress and enhance your personal and professional satisfaction.. . Explore the six elements of the PERMA-V model of well-being (Positive Emotions, Engagement, Relationships, Beaning, Achievement and Vitality) and learn strategies for increasing your experience of each element.. . Walk away with a toolkit of exercises and an action plan for pursuing your own authentic vision of success. .

In this keynote, in an engaging, inspiring, sometimes humorous, and sometimes emotional and dead serious, Dr. Yoram Solomon will start by explaining why we are so obsessed with leadership, what are the true costs to the organization, one of which is how it devastates trust in the organization. He will continue and explain why not everybody should be a leader, and finish with a path forward to get there.\n---\nEvent Details: https://smu360.smu.edu/rsvp?id=377939",2023-10-11T14:23:17, Sign in to download the location,The Cost of Our Obsession with Leadership
